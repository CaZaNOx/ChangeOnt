# Point / Occurrence — generalized happening independent of subject
## Claim (formal)
Point(x) denotes a generalized occurrence implied by change, without requiring a subject. Experienced happening is the subject-conditioned instance of Point.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Things can happen as part of change whether or not a subject is there to experience them.
