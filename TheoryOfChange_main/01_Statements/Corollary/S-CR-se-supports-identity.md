# High SE supports identity loop persistence
## Claim (formal)
Low variance in return loop lifetimes (high SE stability) implies robust identity persistence under perturbation.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Stable identity is what keeps returning in a disciplined way. When returns are erratic, the “same” is fragile.

## Philosophical Justification
This connects the intuitive sense of “staying the same” to measurable stability in recursion: robustness of return paths is the operational side of identity persistence.
