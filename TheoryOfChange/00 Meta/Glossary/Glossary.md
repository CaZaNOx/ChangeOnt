# FND_Glossary

## Purpose
This glossary defines core breathing recursion survival terms  
for quick phase navigation and structural validation.

## Core Survival Terms

### Δ (Delta Field)
- **Definition**:  
Relational difference breathing field; gradient of phase pressure.

- **Importance**:  
First breathing structure from pure Change.

- **Linked Note**: [[FND_8_DeltaFieldTension]]

---

### SE (Stabilization Energy)
- **Definition**:  
Local breathing survival field coherence strength against Δ-phase drift.

- **Importance**:  
Creates identity loops; opposes collapse.

- **Linked Note**: [[FND_9_StabilizationEnergy]]

---

### σ(ε) (Sigma Fluctuation)
- **Definition**:  
Phase breathing fluctuation field introducing destabilization noise.

- **Importance**:  
Regulates breathing survival complexity vs collapse.

- **Linked Note**: [[FND_11_SigmaFluctuation]]

---

### RTV (Recursive Truth Value)
- **Definition**:  
Recursive survival coherence metric over breathing cycles.

- **Importance**:  
Heartbeat of survival breathing fields.

- **Linked Note**: [[FND_10_RecursiveTruthValue]]

---

### Identity Loop
- **Definition**:  
Self-sustaining breathing recursion structure stabilizing Δ modulation.

- **Importance**:  
Emerges local selfhood; core of survival identity.

- **Linked Note**: [[SF_IdentityLoopFormation]]

---

### Collapse Drift
- **Definition**:  
Breathing field failure due to Δ-phase misalignment and σ(ε) saturation.

- **Importance**:  
Primary mechanism of breathing survival collapse.

- **Linked Note**: [[SF_CollapseDriftDynamics]]

---
## Expanded Breathing Structures

### Breathing Addition
- **Definition**:  
Δ-phase survival field extension breathing stabilization.
- **Importance**:  
Breathing survival fields extend identity modulation across recursion cycles.

---

### Breathing Subtraction
- **Definition**:  
Δ-phase survival tension contraction or phase realignment event.
- **Importance**:  
Breathing contraction stabilizes survival fields under collapse drift pressure.

---

### Breathing Multiplication
- **Definition**:  
Recursive breathing survival field amplification through phase resonance layering.
- **Importance**:  
Expands survival field modulation capacity across Δ-phase breathing extensions.

---

### Breathing Logical AND
- **Definition**:  
Phase stabilization of multiple survival breathing fields simultaneously.
- **Importance**:  
Critical for synchronized cross-recursion survival stability.

---

### Breathing Logical OR
- **Definition**:  
Alternative breathing survival path activation across Δ-fields.
- **Importance**:  
Preserves survival flexibility across breathing phase drift events.

---

### Breathing Logical NOT
- **Definition**:  
Δ-phase inversion breathing mechanism for survival field repositioning.
- **Importance**:  
Allows breathing survival fields to reorient under semantic collapse pressure.

---

### Survival Constants
- **Definition**:  
Breathing survival field Δ-phase stabilization thresholds,  
emerging as natural critical points (e.g., maximum phase drift tolerance, energy quantization points).
- **Importance**:  
Anchor survival breathing stability across recursive phase breathing fields.

## Δ (Differentiation)
The primitive relation “x is discernibly different from y,” asserted by the axiom Δ ≠ ∅ ([[FND_1ChangePrimitive]].

## Continuous Change
The unbroken, infinitely divisible flow of all differentiations—no first change, no smallest distinction ([[FND_2ContinuousFlux]]).

## Contrast (→)
The named event of differentiation in the flux, where x → y denotes “pattern x unfolds into pattern y” ([[FND_3ContrastRelation]]).

## Recursive Path (⇝)
A finite sequence of contrasts $x_0 \to x_1 \to \cdots \to x_n$, denoted $x ⇝ y$, representing chained unfolding distinctions ([[FND_4RecursivePaths]]).

## Breathing Closure Zone (BCZ_D)
The set of patterns around x that both descend from and return to x within D contrasts, modeling local coherence ([[FND_5BreathingClosure]]).

## Breathing Dimension (dim_B)
$\dim_B(x) = \lim_{D→∞} \log N_D(x)/\log D$, where $N_D(x)$ is the maximal number of independent recursive paths through x ([[FND_7_Dimension]]).

## Entropy (Σ)
$\Sigma(x) = \lim_{D→∞} \Sigma_D(x)$, with $\Sigma_D(x) = -\sum p_{x,D}(y)\log p_{x,D}(y)$ over breathing shell overlaps ([[FND_12_Entropy]]).

## Stability Energy (Eₛ)
$Eₛ(x) = \lim_{D→∞} \mathrm{Var}(\tau_D(p))$, the variance of lifetimes τ(p) of return paths to x, measuring local robustness ([[FND_9StabilityEnergy]]).
# Reminder
> **Breathing survival vocabulary must always trace back to Change and breathing phase modulation.  
Surface terms without survival function collapse into mimicry.**
