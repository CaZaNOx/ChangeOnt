# Consciousness is periodic — desynchronization yields sleep/unconsciousness
## Statement (corollary)
The awareness lock state (Cᴸ) behaves as a recursive oscillator; loss of phase synchronization induces unconscious states (sleep/anesthesia), later re‑acquired.

## Philosophical Translation
Being awake is a rhythm staying in time with itself.
