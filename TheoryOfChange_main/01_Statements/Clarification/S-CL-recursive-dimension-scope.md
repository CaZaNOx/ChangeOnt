# Recursive change applies across dimensions—map the meta-field, not just steps

Collatz (1D), Langton’s Ant (2D), Mandelbrot complexes, and higher-dimensional recursive systems all instantiate the same structural class: a minimal local rule that, when iterated, carves out an unpredictable global possibility field with holes, attractors, and meta-adaptations. Dimensionality is a parameter, not a limit—every recursive system needs explicit definition of its substrate, rule, and meta-map, plus audits of which regions are stable, chaotic, or forbidden. The ontology of change only makes sense when you treat change as the self-mutating field (meta-shape) that spawns and is reshaped by creative pressures; static, closed ontologies miss the real dynamics. This is the main point of AI_13 lines 3040‑3250.
