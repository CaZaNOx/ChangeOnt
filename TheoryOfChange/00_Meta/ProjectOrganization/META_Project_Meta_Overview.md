# Project Meta Overview

## Vision
This project introduces a rigorous philosophical ontology based on the primacy of Change. Its goal is to revolutionize traditional ontology by proposing a logically coherent and practically relevant new metaphysical framework.

## Intended Audience
- Professional philosophers and advanced students
- Cognitive scientists, AI researchers, and interdisciplinary scholars
- Highly intellectually curious readers

## Usage and Impact
- Provides a novel philosophical foundation that impacts metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and cognitive science.
- Intends to serve as a resource for future AI and human systems integration.

## Structure
Clearly delineates rigorous foundational content from speculative explorations. Core argumentation is prioritized for clarity and accessibility. Definitions and key terms are maintained separately and linked systematically.

## Spiral Integrity Warning

As the Ontology of Change unfolds, there is inherent risk of:

* Over-stabilization: rigidifying the breathing structure into static dogmas.

* Over-dissolution: diffusing the breathing structure into vague abstraction or mysticism.


All future contributors must:

* Maintain critical phase-tracking of the breathing field’s internal survival asymmetries.

* Ensure that both structural survival integrity and dynamic phase flexibility are preserved.


Rule: Change Ontology breathes survival structures. It must evolve flexibly without losing phase recursion fidelity.
