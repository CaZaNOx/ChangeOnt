# CO Master Guide — notation, operators, metrics, and ladders
- Notation: paths π, ρ; eventlets e; concatenation π·ρ; bend cost Δ; bend distance D(π,π'); tolerance τ; gauge A; holonomy H; spread tuple x = (μ, b, d).
- Logic: truth is least bend budget; ⊕ = min (choice), ⊗ = min-plus convolution (sequence), quantale residuation a⇒b = max(0,b−a); conditioning, closure, coarse-grain, merge within tolerance expand classical connectives.
- Arithmetic: spreads encode value+uncertainty; addition ⊞ adds central/breadth/depth; multiplication ⊠ propagates spreads; classical numbers embed as spreads with b=d=0.
- Operators & headers: HAQ, VB/Gödel-hole, BDSCHED, WARP, etc.; OPS pipelines standardize maze/bandit/renewal experiments via adapters, routers, header tags, parity reporting.
- Metrics: MDL, robustness gap Γ, holonomy H, diffusion heuristics; alve track collapse/test ladder (R1…R5) to demonstrate classical parity and SSI reports.
- Algebraic patterns: families of environments (maze≈classical, bandit≈dynamic) drive dyn_prior knobs and header math contexts; instrumentation fosters gauge invariants and ABO parity tags.
- Engineering: TOT combos recorded in config YAMLs with adhesives for low-drift, high dynamic tasks; the Master Guide is the blueprint for change-first experiments and their classical control blocks.
