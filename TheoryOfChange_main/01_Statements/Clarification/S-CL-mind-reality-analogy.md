# Mind is the subjective reality analogous to physical reality

In change ontology, mind is not a static entity but the live, subjective field of experience, awareness, reflection, and self-modulation—just as physical reality is the field the physicist studies. Every description (scientific, philosophical, self-reflective) is a partial map that leaves holes; consciousness keeps generating new differences and escapes any final capture. Treat these analogies as structural homologies to physical reality, not metaphors, and keep admitting the open, hole-filled nature of mind space when developing models or protocols. This formalizes AI_13’s point that mind is the “real” for a subject in the same sense physics is real for physicists (`AI_13` lines 12563‑12648).
