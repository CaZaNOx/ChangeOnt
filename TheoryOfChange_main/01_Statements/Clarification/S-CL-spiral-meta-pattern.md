# The universal meta-pattern is a recursive spiral of branching, crisis, and recombination

Across cosmic, biological, cognitive, and social scales the dominant meta-pattern is spiral: initiation → branching → crisis/return → recombination → new branching. This open spiral lets systems retain memory, integrate difference, and spawn novelty, while avoiding collapse into either stagnation or chaos. Every emergent phenomenon follows this cycle because only such spirals survive—linear or circular sequences cannot encode both innovation and return. When you map new attractors, look for this spiral signature, as AI_13 lines 9700‑10180 document.
