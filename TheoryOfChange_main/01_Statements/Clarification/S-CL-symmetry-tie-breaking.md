# Symmetry, tie-breaking, and entropy floors

When OPS detects options that are symmetric (ΔΦ̂ and risk̂ within ε_tie) the agent enforces an entropy floor `H_min` so that the policy spreads probability mass rather than duplicating the same move. If the same move repeats `m` times with zero progress (`ΔΦ≈0`), an anti-streak penalty nudges the controller to explore alternative directions. CO uses `P14` re-identification frequencies `E_ε[1_T]` to check the Law of Large Numbers: if a tie persists without converging frequencies, the responsible forecast is demoted until recalibration. When evidence upgrades the tie (improvements consistent with predictions and MDL drops), the entropy floor can be relaxed; the penalty/resistance is only as strong as the calibration requires.
