# Change-based fitness (CBF)
## Claim (formal)
CBF(P) := weighted aggregation of SRL(P), identity persistence (SE, θ), and successful Tx usage with minimal GH backlog.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Fitness measures how well a pattern keeps recurring and holding together while adapting frames honestly.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- CBF is domain‑specific via weights; it is not a classical probability but a structural viability score.

## Derivation (Formal)
```text
CBF(P) := w1*SRL(P) + w2*Stab(P; SE,θ) - w3*GH_backlog(P) + w4*Tx_success(P)
```
