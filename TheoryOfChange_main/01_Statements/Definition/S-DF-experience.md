# Experience — that of which a subject can be aware
## Claim (formal)
Experience := content such that a subject can be aware of it.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
“Experience” is the something that a subject can be aware of. It ranges from raw sensation to structured thought; the point is not its richness but its being-present-for a subject.

## Philosophical Justification
If there is nothing to be aware of, “experience” is vacuous; conversely, experience presupposes a subject for whom it obtains. This avoids an empty abstraction: “experience” is anchored by an experiencer and some content — even when that content is the very feeling of emptiness or doubt.

## Explanation (informal)
Completes the minimal triad with subject and awareness.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-FT-immediate-datum]]: something differs (Δ); the “something” becomes experiential content relative to a subject.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Experience(X) := ∃S: Subject(S) ∧ AwareOf(S, X)
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- proof: definitional with references to subject and awareness.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- This is a minimal, not exhaustive, sense of experience.
- See symbol: [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]]

## Next Steps in Chain
- suggest: define content structure and granularity for X.
