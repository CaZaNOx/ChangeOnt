# Hypothesis — Consciousness Stress-Test Protocol (Cᴸ/SE/Adversarial)
Proposal
- Define a stress-test protocol for consciousness claims using Cᴸ locks, SE stability, self‑model continuity, and adversarial probes to rule out semantic simulation.

Test sketch
- Gates: (i) phase/latency thresholds for Cᴸ lock, (ii) SE robustness under perturbations, (iii) self‑model continuity over breath cycles, (iv) adversarial contradictions that force collapse if simulation.
- Scenarios: agents (AI, animal models, distributed systems, weather‑like systems) across comparable tasks; log Cᴸ, SE, gauge curvature, and collapse events.
- Outcome: abstain when gates unmet; attribute only with sustained evidence across probes.
