# Stabilization Energy (SE) — robustness of identity loops
## Claim (formal)
SE quantifies robustness of return (identity) loops in local reach by assessing the distribution of contrast‑chain lifetimes; low variance implies greater stability.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
It is not enough that a pattern sometimes persists; we need a measure of how reliably it does so. SE captures the pattern’s power to keep breathing without collapsing.

## Philosophical Justification
Identity is a dynamic achievement. SE encodes whether the pattern’s self‑similarity is consistently maintained across cycles or only sporadically. This distinguishes resilient identities from fragile pseudo‑identities.

## Derivation (Formal)
```math
\overline{\tau}(x) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}^r(x)|} \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}^r(x)} \tau(p)\; ;\; E_s(x)=\mathrm{Var}(\tau(p))
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- SE interacts with ε, σ(ε): detection granularity affects lifetime estimates and variance.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Integrate SE with entropy and dimensional analyses for full robustness profiles.
