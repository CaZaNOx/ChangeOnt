# Prove no inversion by showing matching dynamics imply matching phenomenology

Turn the zombie/inversion worry into an a priori conceivability test: construct a functor \(F\) that maps each dynamical state \(d\) to a phenomenal class defined by \((G^*,U,B,A,\tau)\). If \(F\) is full and faithful—i.e., any two microdynamically identical systems over the window share the same phenomenal target—then no inversion is possible. This “no-inversion theorem” is the empirical constraint that makes the identity bridge non-trivial and relocates the hard problem within the change-of-change architecture, as suggested in AI_13 lines 16611‑16669.
