# Define operators before usage in foundational documents

Before any operator or relation appears in a proof or narrative, it must be defined with a DF/CR block that specifies its domain, dependencies, and key properties. FND_2–FND_4 must first introduce `Δ(x,y)`, `Reach(x,y)`, `C(x,y,p)`, and their continuity/gauge constraints before using them in telescoped arguments. This ensures that later derivations can cite stable IDs instead of informal prose and prevents smuggled assumptions from creeping in via the back door.
