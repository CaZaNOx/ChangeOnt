# Gödel-hole / collapse event operators for non-classical transitions
## Claim
Define operators that detect and act upon Gödel-hole transitions—events where the underlying space-subject structure must change because classical rules fail. These operators mark when a collapsing attractor demands new structure (boundary migration, new phase, shifted subject) and log the collapse ledger for benchmarking against classical models.

## Sketch
- Track invariants (Δ, SE, pointer reach) until they breach thresholds; when they do, raise a Gödel-hole flag and apply an operator that reconfigures the space-subject mapping.
- The operator emits a collapse ledger entry specifying which rule ruptured and which new structure is needed for the field to continue.

## Implication
With these operators we gain measurable, reproducible indicators of structure-changing events, fulfilling the AI_13 demand for quantifiable non-classical factors and letting future agents log genuine Gödel-hole collapses.
