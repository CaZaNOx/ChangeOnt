# Change-based benchmark protocol
## Claim (formal)
Benchmarks should measure: SRL, identity persistence (SE, θ), indicator incidence (non‑classical triggers), and collapse rates (⊘) under breath. Compare against classical models for the same tasks.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Test what matters in change: recurrence, robustness, and where fixed‑space models silently fail.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Report not just accuracy but structure: how often GHs occur, how Tx is needed, and where models break.
