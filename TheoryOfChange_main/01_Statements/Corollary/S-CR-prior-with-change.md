# Prior-with-Change — recursive prior induced by Reach and Locality
## Statement (corollary)
Given Δ(Now), Reach, and Locality, the “prior” is not a static parameter but a recursively updated trace over LocalReach neighborhoods, maintained by pointers and path structure. Hence, prior belief/state evolves with the ongoing change it summarizes.

## Philosophical Translation
What you already “have” is not fixed; the very act of continuing updates what counts as your prior.

## Clarifications / Links to definitions
- From [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-pointer-structural]] and [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-reach-relation]]: pointers and reach encode how the present is stitched from admissible steps.
- From [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-locality-prior]]: only locally reachable configurations inform the prior.
- From [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-path-eventlet-chain]]: priors compose along eventlet chains.
