# Counterfactual — reading-now case and generalization to Immediate Datum
## Content
The initial “You are reading this now” can fail in edge cases (e.g., indirect report). Generalizing to Immediate Datum (Δ ≠ ∅) removes dependence on content or channel while preserving performative consistency: denial re‑enacts Δ.

## Implication
This justifies the shift from a content‑specific assertion to a content‑independent foundational truth.
