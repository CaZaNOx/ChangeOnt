# New variables emerge only when structural tension forces a distinction

In the change ontology, a new variable/dimension arises when the subject encounters unresolved structural tension that cannot be collapsed with existing distinctions. The pointer collapse protocol identifies the need: if a pointer cannot anchor a new happening within the current structure, the subject must posit the minimal new variable required to discriminate that experience. This emergence happens as part of the ledgered protocol and is not an arbitrary labeling choice; it is a structural necessity born from collapse/tension events, as illustrated in AI_13 lines 785‑884.
