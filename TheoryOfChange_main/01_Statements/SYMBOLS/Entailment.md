# ⥤ — Structural entailment

Definition (formal):
Entailment relation specific to recursive/structural derivations, replacing logical → where transformation of space/subject is implicated.

Explanation:
Used to distinguish structural derivations from purely propositional inference.

## Math
```math
\text{If } A(\lnot P) \Rightarrow P \;\; \text{then } P.
```
Interpreted as entailment where the act A structurally presupposes P.

## Example
- In performative contradiction schema: Act(¬P) ⥤ Requires(P) ⥤ P

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
Some acts or structures carry what they claim to deny; when an act requires P, P holds in that structure.

## Philosophical Justification
Structural entailment captures cases where inference is about the configuration of acting/knowing, not just propositions. Performative contradiction is one such case.

## Explanation (informal)
We use ⥤ to mark entailments that depend on transformation or context (e.g., the act’s preconditions), beyond material implication.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- ⥤ is not a replacement for →; it supplements it where structure changes (frame, space, subject) matter.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Formalize ⥤ within CO_LOGIC (rule schemas, introduction/elimination rules).
