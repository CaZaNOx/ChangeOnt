# CO Ontic vs Policy (Kernel Summary)

This is a kernel-facing summary. See `docs/co/CO_OnticVsPolicy.md` for full detail.
- PSD (no effect without difference) is an ontic commitment.
- CP-E (epistemic divisibility) is a defeasible method; no global closure claims.
- NCP/ROT: Non-Closure Principle and Re-Open Triggers are **frontier-only**; kernel stays neutral.
