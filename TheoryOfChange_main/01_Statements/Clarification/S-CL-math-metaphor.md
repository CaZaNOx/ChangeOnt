# Classical math primitives hide object-time metaphors
## Content
Conventional primitives (set, function, equality) smuggle object permanence, temporal direction, and static identity into mathematics. Starting from change instead would produce a different foundational vocabulary and keep the metaphysical load explicit.

## Clarification
- Set-theoretic collections imply pre-existing objects; functions assume input/output temporality; equality presumes unchanging identity. Each hides change under a metaphor that once accepted makes change secondary.
- Change-first math should instead define these primitives through relational difference traces, tolerance radii, and breath-field bends, making the metaphors explicit and avoidable.

## Implication
This helps identify when the theory recoils into classical metaphysics—it can flag the metaphor and re-derive the needed structure explicitly from recursive change dynamics, as AI_19 urged.
