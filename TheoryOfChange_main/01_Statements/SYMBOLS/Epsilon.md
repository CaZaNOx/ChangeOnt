# ε — Sensitivity threshold

Definition (formal):
Minimal perceptible change; below ε, change may be indistinguishable at current resolution.

## Math
```math
\text{Detect}(\Delta) := |\Delta| > \varepsilon
```

## Example
- Thresholds for collapse or detection in protocols.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Sigma_epsilon]] (σ(ε))
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Mu_mod]] (μ_mod)
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta_lower]] (δ)

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
Detection isn’t infinite; there is a smallest noticeable difference at any moment.

## Philosophical Justification
Attention and instruments have limits. A theory of change must model when change is below the horizon of detection.

## Explanation (informal)
ε is the knob that sets when δ becomes visible to the subject/observer.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- ε is context-dependent and can be adapted by the subject or system.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Couple ε dynamics to σ(ε) and pointer stability.
