# Collapse drift regimes — interpretive phases around RTV thresholds
## Content
Characterizes early/mid/collapse regimes as interpretive neighborhoods around the formal collapse threshold, modulated by σ(ε). These regimes guide diagnostics but are not additional axioms.

## Implication
Keeps the core formalism minimal (threshold behavior), with regime language as reader guidance.
