# Primitive — Variable birth (latent dimension addition under pressure + MDL gain)
## Claim (formal)
Introduce a new latent variable when structural pressure is high and the MDL (compression) gain is positive. Birth criteria jointly consider stabilization energy, recurrence structure, and description-length improvement.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
New degrees of freedom emerge when the system can explain more with less by adding them — growth when the pattern demands a larger room.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Couples novelty pressure with conservative model selection (avoid overfitting; reward compressibility).
- Downstream: identity maintenance under new coordinates (quotients/closure).
