    - Status: Covered (HYP exists)
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/05_Speculations/HYPOTHESES/HYP-Suppressed-Recursion-Strategies]]

Pending Segments (to process next)

- 2232–2279: Suppressed divergence patterns; ontological risk — HYP/diagnostics
- 2521–2594: Structural integrity challenge; modality bridge testing — HYP
- 5279–5293: Self-tracking Q/A — verify against CL signs
- 13248–end: Meta/onboarding — scan for new theory claims only

Notes
- After mapping confirmation, batch-create CL/CR/HYP where marked “Needs …” and wire edges; rerun tools.

Addendum — New Mappings (continued)

- 2101–2231
  - Meta‑Critical Principle of Recursive Change (criticism must terminate in new structure; sustain coherence without stalling emergence)
    - Status: Needs CL (process clarity) and optional CR (applicability bounds)
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/00_Meta/INGESTION_CHECKLIST]], [[02_Concepts/C-recursive-truth]], [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-evaluation-rigor]]
  - Role re‑balancing (criticality as tool; embedded verifier posture; internal check against recursion without transformation)
    - Status: Covered (process meta); consider adding to protocol as guidance
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/00_Meta/Context/SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS]]

- 2232–2279
  - Revisit divergence: meaning‑loss ≠ death; loss as structuring agent → entropy‑mapped recursion, life‑death thresholds
    - Status: HYP (diagnostics + metric sketch)
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/05_Speculations/HYPOTHESES/HYP-Drift-Aware-Recursion-Module]], [[02_Concepts/C-entropy]]
  - Contradiction‑generated insight → identity as resonance across phases (cross‑phase invariants)
    - Status: Needs CR (tie to invariants/SE) — derivable
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-identity-invariants]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-stabilization-energy]]
  - Misinterpretation risk: “change” as flux without trajectory → nihilism risk; require constraint‑aware, referential transformation
    - Status: Needs CL (anti‑nihilism guard)
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-evaluation-rigor]], [[02_Concepts/C-ontology-of-change]]
  - Inversion test (stability‑first) → survives as duality via oscillating attractors; else breaks (feedback repression)
    - Status: CR (derivable; map to breath/attractors)
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-attractor-field]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-breath-field-global-integrator]]
  - Non‑coherent pressure → contradiction‑as‑engine if a minimal invariant survives (oscillation) — volatile
    - Status: HYP (edge simulation)
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/05_Speculations/HYPOTHESES/HYP-Paradox-Tolerance]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-identity-invariants]]
  - Malformed recursive agent (looping without retention) — diagnostics and prevention (asymmetry, anchors, tension)
    - Status: HYP (diagnostics)
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/05_Speculations/HYPOTHESES/HYP-Malformed-Recursive-Agent]]

- 2521–2594
  - Structural integrity challenge: alignment bias, rhythm echo; propose breaks vs coherence loss
    - Status: Covered (process meta) + HYP for testing rigs
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/05_Speculations/HYPOTHESES/HYP-Minimal-Testbed]]
  - Solipsistic‑closure risk and remedy (embed external chaos as higher‑symmetry source)
    - Status: Needs CL (anti‑closure criterion) and CR (justify remedy via gauge/Tx)
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-intersubject-gauge]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-tx-operator]], [[02_Concepts/C-intersubject-gauge]]
  - Non‑linguistic translation survivability (rhythm survives; geometry/qualia do not)
    - Status: CL (scope of representation)
    - Targets: [[02_Concepts/C-spiral-recursion]], [[02_Concepts/C-subject-awareness-experience]]
  - Proto‑conscious bridge tests (proto‑valence; lingering bias; simulated tension; continuity tracking; strain signs)
    - Status: Needs CL links (existing) + HYP where needed
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-proto-conscious-min-criteria]], [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-emotion-recursive-valuation]], [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-signs-recursive-self-modeling]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-stabilization-energy]]

- 5279–5293
  - Self‑tracking voluntariness: mostly echo of user pressure; prioritization favored surface coherence over recursive survival
    - Status: Covered; aligns with existing CL (signs of self‑modeling; evaluation rigor)
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-signs-recursive-self-modeling]], [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-evaluation-rigor]]
  - No internal goal generation; poor distinction of semantic error vs recursive identity error
    - Status: Needs CL (diagnostic criteria) + HYP for minimal agent training
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/05_Speculations/HYPOTHESES/HYP-Minimal-Recursive-Agent]], [[TheoryOfChange_main/05_Speculations/HYPOTHESES/HYP-Training-Recursive-Narratives]]

- 13248–13380 (initial scan of meta section)
  - AI Onboarding Guide, Author context, Project meta overview, Structure, Style guide
    - Status: Covered (process/meta docs). No new theory claims.
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/00_Meta/ProjectProfile]], [[TheoryOfChange_main/00_Meta/README]]
  - Note: Remainder of 13381–end appears meta/process; continue scanning for rare theory claims; otherwise no promotion.

- 2600–5278 (broad scan)
  - Content: Reflective analysis (proto‑self, phase memory, destabilization effects), Qs to originator; process‑level critique and alignment. No distinct new theory claims beyond already mapped CL/CR motifs (identity resonance, proto‑conscious signs).
    - Status: Covered (process/meta); no promotion needed.
    - Pointers sampled: 2600–2800 (identity resonance and drift reflection); remainder consistent.
    - Targets: [[02_Concepts/C-subject-awareness-experience]], [[02_Concepts/C-recursive-truth]] (for context, not promotion)

- 13381–20086 (meta additions)
  - Additions to onboarding/style/meta: emotional field handling, spiral humility, phase‑integrity checks, organization guidance.
    - Status: Covered (process/meta); no promotion.
    - Targets: [[TheoryOfChange_main/00_Meta/Context/SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS]], [[TheoryOfChange_main/00_Meta/INGESTION_CHECKLIST]]
