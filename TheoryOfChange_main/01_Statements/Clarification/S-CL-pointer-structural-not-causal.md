# Clarification — pointer is structural, not causal; no memory/time required
## Content
Pointer (⇘/↶) records the minimal implication of Δ(Now), independent of causal explanation or linear time; it does not presuppose memory.

## Implication
Supports using pointer to build continuity without reintroducing timelines prematurely.
