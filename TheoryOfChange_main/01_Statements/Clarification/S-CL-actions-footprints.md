# Every action imprints structural footprints that bias future change

A “jump,” “action,” or “event” is not consumed and forgotten; it leaves informational biases (memory traces) and structural shifts (environment/possibility rewrites) that persist in the field. These footprints alter the availability of future attractors, holes, or variables and make the field itself a recorder of its history. Account for both the informational residue and the structural deformities whenever you trace why a variable stabilized, collapsed, or invited new meta-dynamics, as described in AI_13 lines 3968‑3998.
