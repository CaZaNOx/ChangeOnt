# Counterfactual — if diff(x,y)=∅ under x⇘y then x=y and arisal is not self-caused
## Content
Assuming x⇘y yet diff(x,y)=∅ collapses to x=y; then “arisal(y)” cannot be explained by y causing itself. This validates using discriminability to avoid self‑causing arisal.

## Implication
Reinforces structural pointer semantics and the need for diff/≈ criteria.
