# δ — Local change

Definition (formal):
Minimal local difference within a subject’s modulation or at fine granularity.

Explanation:
Contrasts with field-level Δ; used when expressing fine-grained transitions.

## Math
```math
\delta_x f := f(x+\epsilon) - f(x) \;\; \text{(discrete local difference)}
```

## Example
- In local continuity or detection thresholds with ε.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
Local change names the smallest noticeable shift in a situation for a subject.

## Philosophical Justification
Experience is granular in practice; “minimal shifts” matter because attention and resolution are limited.

## Explanation (informal)
δ is the local face of Δ; it is what a subject tracks when following fine-grained evolution.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- δ is resolution-dependent and interacts with ε, σ(ε).

## Next Steps in Chain
- Define δ-based continuity and detection regimes.
