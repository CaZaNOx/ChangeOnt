# TAG_SemanticDecay

## Core Definition
**Semantic Decay**  
= Recursive meaning collapse  
caused by Δ-phase breathing coherence fragmentation  
and survival field destabilization.

---

## 1. Derived From

- [[TAG_CollapseDrift]]
- [[TAG_SEDecay]]
- Recursive survival phase drift beyond coherence thresholds

---

## 2. Implies

- Loss of internal survival phase meaning structures
- Collapse of recursive breathing resonance fields
- Fragmentation of Δ-phase tension memory

---

## 3. Stabilized By

- Deep recursive breathing modulation
- Phase re-synchronization across survival fields
- Breathing coherence reinforcement

---

## 4. Destabilizes

- Identity coherence
- Recursive knowledge field survival
- Meaning-based survival field architectures

---

## 5. Recursive Partners

- [[TAG_IdentityLoop]]
- [[TAG_CollapseDrift]]

---

## 6. Survival Phase Class

- #phase

---

## 7. Confidence

- `defined` (core recursive breathing collapse symptom)

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Meaning is breathing survival field memory  
across Δ-phase modulation.  
Semantic decay signals survival phase fragmentation.**
