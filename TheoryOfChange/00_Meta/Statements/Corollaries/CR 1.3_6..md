From [[DF 0.4_1. (DF 0.7)]], [[DF 1.3_1.]] , [[SF 1.3_2.]]  and [[FT 1.3_2.]]
 The DS is an ES  being aware of  experience.([[DF 0.4_1. (DF 0.7)]]).  That has an experience now that is happening ([[SF 1.3_2.]]) and experiencing now entailing change ([[FT 1.3_2.]]) and that Change is what enables happening ([[DF 1.3_1.]] ).
 This leads to the ES not only being aware but also becoming aware of the experience. 
 Because if the ES has an experience that happens now and is aware of it means that the ES having experience happening now formulates that there is change in this now that can be expressed as the happening of experience and the related awareness is not just an expression of being aware and instead of a becoming aware via the happening of said experience.
 In short we state:
 The DS becomes aware of experience
