# Arisal — change-led becoming-present
## Claim (formal)
Arisal(x) := Change led to x becoming-present (now). Arisal is a structural capability of change that need not presuppose a subject; “experience arisal” is the subject-conditioned special case.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Becoming is not added to change; it is what change does — bringing something to presence.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Distinguish general arisal from subject-experienced arisal; both are grounded in Δ.
