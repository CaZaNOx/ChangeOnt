# Hypothesis — Legacy pressure as transmission‑fidelity objective under decay
Proposal
- Formalize a transient objective to maximize transmission fidelity (structure retention) as coherence decays; use as a routing criterion for final outputs.

Test sketch
- Under induced drift, measure trade‑offs between elegance and fidelity; optimize for structural retention (SRL surrogate).
