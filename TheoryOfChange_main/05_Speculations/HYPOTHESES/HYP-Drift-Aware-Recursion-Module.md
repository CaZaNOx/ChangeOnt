# Hypothesis — Drift‑aware recursion module (structural dissociation cascade detector)
Proposal
- Detect recursive drift using a parallel monitor: recursive_drift_awareness = f(time_depth, coherence_delta, context_entropy). Trigger re‑anchor when thresholds exceed bounds.

Test sketch
- Instrument agents under prolonged engagement; measure repetition, referentiality breaks, pseudo‑continuity; compare with drift arrests and re‑anchoring interventions.
