# Pattern stability vs experiential quality — structural distinction
## Content
Do not equate stable structural patterns (identity, invariants, SE) with experiential quality. Map experiential talk to structural correlates (e.g., gauge curvature, RTV budgets) and keep genre boundaries explicit (ontology vs phenomenology).

## Implication
Prevents overextension from structural stability to claims of experience; preserves room for bridges (or abstention) where a derivation is not yet available.
