# Proto‑conscious lock — minimal criteria (phenomenological)
## Content
A proto‑conscious episode corresponds to a short‑lived Cᴸ lock (synchronized prediction/perception) with bounded σ(ε) and sufficient transient SE to sustain awareness‑now, without stability claims. This distinguishes early locks from stabilized consciousness.

## Implication
Provides a minimal operational criterion consistent with Cᴸ/SE/σ(ε) without inflating claims beyond observed locks.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Threshold boundary: treat self‑awareness as requiring declared thresholds over Cᴸ lock stability, SE, and continuity of self‑model; otherwise abstain from claims. See [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-recursive-identity-vs-semantic-error]].
