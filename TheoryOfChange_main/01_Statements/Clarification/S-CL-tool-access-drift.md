# Tool-access drift must halt the pass

Any file/tool ambiguity or error (e.g., FileNotFound, missing archive) must immediately fire the `⊘ Tool access drift` response and stop the traversal; smoothing, continuation, or narrative fillers are forbidden. This hard stop keeps the enforcement gate intact, so every future agent must prove they can recover only after the drift has been acknowledged and the environment reset, rather than masking the failure with smooth prose.
