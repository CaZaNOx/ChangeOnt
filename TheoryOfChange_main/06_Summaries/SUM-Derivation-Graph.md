# Derivation Graph — how to read and navigate

Scope
- Practical guide to the DAG in `03_Derivation/graph.yaml` and its companion `03_Derivation/Derivation.md`.

Core pointers
- Start at: Root → Immediate Datum → Continuity → Identity blocks.
- Axes: Pointer/Reach/Tx; Identity/Similarity/SE/Entropy; RTV/Breath; GH/Limits; Logic/Quantale.

Tips
- Use backlinks in statements to see “Referenced By” and “Relationships”.
- Concepts in `02_Concepts` aggregate key statements per theme.

Open items
- Keep the DAG readable: only promote items once justified (see Speculations for candidates).
