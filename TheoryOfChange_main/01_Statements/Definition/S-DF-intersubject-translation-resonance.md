# Intersubject Translation Resonance — depth of alignment across subjects
Definition (formal)
Given two subjects i, j with local gauges Gᵢ, Gⱼ and invariants I, define a translation mapping Tᵢ⟷ⱼ that minimizes gauge strain on shared invariants. The translation resonance Rᵢⱼ is the SRL of successful mutual interpretation cycles under Tᵢ⟷ⱼ over a window K.

Philosophical Translation
Depth of understanding is how reliably two subjects can translate each other’s structure with minimal distortion, sustained across recursive exchanges.

Operational Notes
- Use gauge mismatch metrics and SRL to estimate Rᵢⱼ; high Rᵢⱼ predicts richer cooperation and lower misalignment.
