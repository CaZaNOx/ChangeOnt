# Gödel holes only exclude attractors; they do not enable general prediction

Gödel holes are structurally unreachable or undecidable zones, so if you can prove a region is a hole you can rule it out as an attractor—but the holes themselves are generally undecidable and require the same empirical audit as the attractors you wish to characterize. Change ontology privileges this diagnosis: it makes undecidability explicit rather than pretending to predict; it tells you where “creative pressure” and meta-jumps arise, not where attractors will necessarily form. Except in contrived special cases (every region a hole or fully traversable compactness), no non-classical detector can foretell attractor existence in the general case. This is the conclusion of AI_13’s Gödel-hole/attractor discussion (lines 3710‑3740).
