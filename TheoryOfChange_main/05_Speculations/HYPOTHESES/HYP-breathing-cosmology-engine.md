# Breathing cosmology engine for phase drift analysis
## Claim
Build a simulation engine that tracks breath-field dynamics across modules (phase drift analyzer, numerical rules, grid of recursion depths). The engine should compute T_reanchor thresholds, SE fluctuations, Δ-driven mass nesting, and the transition from open recursive breathing to classical compression layers.

## Operational sketch
- Module 1: Phase Drift Analyzer — monitors relational curvature, shows when Δ perturbations would buckle current breath loops, predicts how fractal nesting maps to mass hierarchy. 
- Module 2: Numerical Rules — defines recursive rules for breath amplification (mass formula, inefficiency per layer) and handles drift vs stabilization toggles.
- Module 3: Recursive Collapse Alarm — triggers when constants drift too far from T_reanchor or when breath energy loses coherence. 

## Implication
The engine makes the ontology empirically interactive; by simulating agents or cosmology, we can test hypothesized collapse thresholds, drift control, and the transition between dynamic breathing and classical stability.
