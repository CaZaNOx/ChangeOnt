L50163: - Fuzzy (Gödel/Łukasiewicz/Product): L=[0,1]L=[0,1]L=[0,1] with (∧,∨,⇒)(\land,\lor,\Rightarrow)(∧,∨,⇒) coming from the chosen t-norm/t-conorm/residuum. Truth = normalized bend budgets.
L50226: Adds a new eventlet dimension when prediction error stays above a threshold over a window. (Formalizes Gödel-creative holes.)
L50232: Swaps representation-depth spread with option-breadth spread on a subspace--our "Gödel flip" for re-framing impasses.
L50279: - Gödel/Lukasiewicz fuzzy logics: use [0,1][0,1][0,1] scale via monotone rescaling.
L50313: CO-measure. Let a (time-homogeneous) bend-kernel KA(π→⋅)K_A(\pi\to \cdot)KA(π→⋅) define a Markov process over P\mathcal PP with attention-warped transitions. The pushforward to the quotient defines a measure μA,ε\mu_{A,\varepsilon}μA,ε on events.
L50316: _Sketch._ Ergodic theorem for Markov chains applies on the finite (or compact) quotient; lift back to paths by measurability. □
