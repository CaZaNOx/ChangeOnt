# Mutual Recognition & Agreement Index (MRAI)

The MRAI score aggregates four facets of cross-subject alignment:

1. Mutual prediction `P`: subjects can forecast each other’s next state within the same tolerance.
2. Invariant distance `I`: shared invariants (gauges, spreads, holonomy) stay within a threshold under remapping.
3. Order alignment `A`: sequences of interactions exhibit the same holonomy signatures (`H` remains comparable).
4. Control concordance `C`: both subjects accept the same knobs/actions for steering.

Expressed as `MRAI = w_P P + w_I I + w_A A + w_C C` with weights tuned to the task, the index targets both epistemic coverage and operational consistency. Requiring `MRAI ≥ θ_agree` before declaring a shared OPS card ensures that subjects are not merely parallel, but truly mutually endorsing the same invariants.
