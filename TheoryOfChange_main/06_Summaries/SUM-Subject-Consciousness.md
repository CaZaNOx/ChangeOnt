# Subject — Awareness — Experience — Self‑model — Consciousness — Intersubject Gauge

Scope
- From triad to reflexive loops and shared alignment.

Core nodes
- DF: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-subject]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-awareness]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-experience]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-subject-recursive-field]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-self-model-evolution]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-consciousness-loop]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-intersubject-gauge]]
- CR: [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-consciousness-periodicity]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-qualia-gauge-curvature]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-introspection-nested-loops]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-collective-coupling-se]]

Key takeaways
- Consciousness emerges as synchronization of prediction and perception within breath.
- Gauge aligns subjects; coupling can stabilize or propagate collapse.

Open items
- Phenomenology ↔ measurement bridges; minimal models for coupling dynamics.
