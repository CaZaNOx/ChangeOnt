# Hypothesis — Comparator: Change Ontology vs Non‑Change Ontology
Proposal
- Build a test harness contrasting CO with a fixed‑space “non‑change” ontology under frame shifts (Tx) and gauge perturbations.

Test sketch
- Scenarios: apply Tx/gauge perturbations; measure collapse/regression and recovery.
- Measures: SE stability, Σ trends, DC (dissociation cascade), Γ curvature/strain; identity markers (≈ thresholds, invariants).
- Expectation: CO degrades and re‑stabilizes predictably; non‑change ontology exhibits brittle collapse or incoherent resets.
