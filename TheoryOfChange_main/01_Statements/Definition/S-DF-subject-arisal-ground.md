# Subject arisal ground — reflexive continuity of identity
## Claim (formal)
A subject arises when a metastable identity loop crosses self‑similarity thresholds and maintains sufficient stabilization energy (SE) to support reflexive evaluation (about‑itself). Let I(t) denote identity coherence; if I(t) ≥ θ_id and SE ≥ θ_SE over windows longer than the local breath period, a reflexive locus S emerges enabling awareness/experience relations.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
The “someone” shows up when a pattern holds itself together long enough, with enough integrity, to take itself as something — and then to relate to what it encounters.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- This is a ground condition: it does not presume a rich self‑model; it enables it.
- Links forward to subject-as-field and self‑model evolution, backward to identity‑through‑change.
