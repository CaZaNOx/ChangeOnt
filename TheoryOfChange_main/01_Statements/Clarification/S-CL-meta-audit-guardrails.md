# Ground meta-level claims in empirical audit and mapping

The complexity of this change ontology is only justified when every higher-level claim is tethered to empirical audit, recursive sampling, and explicit tracing of meta-moves, hole responses, and innovation events. Without that anchoring, analogies about spirals, Mandebrot shapes, or Gödel pressure become unfalsifiable speculation. The right defense is to map each narrative step back to path logs, pointer collapse entries, and ledgered meta-change so the theory remains measurable, comparable, and operative—as AI_13 emphasizes in the 2724‑2766 band.

Whenever the discussion veers toward meta-shapes or emergent structures, add a pointer to the ledger/instrumentation files and require a practical pathway for reproduction; otherwise label the claim as a hypothesis or leave it pending.
