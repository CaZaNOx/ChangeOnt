# Probabilistic language maps to SRL/Evaluation Surface (no absolute probability assumed)
## Content
Statements about “probable paths” or “fields of options around Now” are interpreted via Structural Recurrence Likelihood (SRL) on the evaluation surface, not as assertions of classical, frame‑independent probability. This preserves rigor under frame changes and identity shifts.
