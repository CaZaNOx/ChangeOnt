# Becoming aware entails change (Δ)
## Claim (formal)
For any subject S and content X, the act/state of becoming aware of X is itself a modulation within Δ; awareness is a mode of change rather than an origin outside it.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Noticing is change. Whenever awareness “turns on” or shifts, that very happening is part of change — not something prior to or outside it.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-FT-immediate-datum]] and the triad (subject–awareness–experience), awareness events instantiate Δ rather than ground it.
- From [[S-CR-observation-subordinate]], observation/awareness are subordinate to change; hence becoming aware entails Δ.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- This does not fix a temporal metric; it asserts structural participation of awareness in Δ.
- See symbol: [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]]
