# Primitive — ChangeOps core (motif algebra library)
## Claim (formal)
Provide compose/split/quotient over motif classes (X/≈_ε) with closure guarantees; supports EI and OPS/J suite.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
We need a toolkit to build, compare, and simplify change structures — and it should respect when “near enough” counts as the same.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Serves as a basis for operators J1–J4 and EI.
