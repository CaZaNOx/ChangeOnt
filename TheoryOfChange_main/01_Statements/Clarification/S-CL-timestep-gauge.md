# Δt gauge adapts time-step under calm vs burst regimes

Instead of committing to a global Δt, CO uses a Δt gauge that shrinks during bursts (collapse warnings, high loop_score) and grows during calm phases, all gated by headers/regret triggers. Compute cost becomes `∑_t 1/Δt_t`, letting CO reduce total steps for the same error budget relative to any fixed-Δt classical integrator. The gauge is event-driven and tied to the same collapse/loop/hysteresis machinery that prevents classical collapse—when the gauge is left free to tune, CO maintains precision without oversampling. This formalizes the streaming dynamics example from AI_15.
