# Identity Orchestrator and birth/reset governance

The Identity Orchestrator (EIᴼ) promotes to a higher identity level when the current level stalls (`ΔΦ̂` small) but the next level’s predicted score exceeds a threshold and its forecasts remain calibrated. Demotion happens if the executed `ΔΦ` keeps missing the forecasts and cycle risk spikes. After promotions/births there is a refractory period `T_ref` during which no new promotion or birth can occur unless an extreme failure (Γ collapse or ΔMDL>0) forces rollback. EA shrinks/expands warp `α` based on optimism/pessimism, EB fires births only when hold-out compression gain and robustness stay favorable and the refractory window is clear, EG adjusts resolution granularity before rechecking EB gates, EF raises header dynamism during volatility, and any flip in `e_MDL` after birth leads to probation or rollback. Stability credit extends refractory windows if the fresh level reliably meets its forecasts for `T_stab`. This choreography keeps identity growth conservative, testable, and reversible.
