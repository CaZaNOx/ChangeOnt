# Boolean logic emerges as a two-point collapse of the graded lattice
## Statement (corollary)
Classical Boolean logic appears when the graded order collapses to two points, preserving only exact equivalence and total exclusion.

## Philosophical Translation
Black‑and‑white logic is the flattest case of a richer landscape.
