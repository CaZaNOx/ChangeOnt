# Counterfactual — a subject with no current experience
## Content
If an entity has no experience now, it does not qualify as a subject now (in the triad sense). The term “subject” denotes an entity bearing awareness of experience in the present.

## Implication
Clarifies the triad: definitions are co‑referential and evaluated at Now; “subject” is not a bare substance independent of awareness/experience.
