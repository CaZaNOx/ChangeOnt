# CO's three pillars prevent collapse while enabling separation

To avoid collapsing to classical heuristics you must keep three guardrails live: (1) header gating (loop score + EMA + hysteresis/cooldown + collapse header H/variance) to regulate spawn/reap/distinctions, (2) explicit compute pricing and prune/regulator ledger (active-var-seconds, digits-seconds, FLOPs, memory caps) so every adaptation phase is accountable, and (3) quotient/gauge discipline that treats ticks/precision as measurement regimes rather than ontological primitives. When you preserve these pillars and preregister their thresholds/triggers, CO can reproduce any frozen classical config (embedding lemma) yet retain separation power on intermittent, bursty, or loop-rich tasks; if any pillar is diluted, you collapse back to classical behavior.
