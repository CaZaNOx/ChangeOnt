From [[CR 1.2_20.]] and [[CR 1.3_5.]] 
The Now(E$_x$) of the DS could be conceptualized in 2 different ways.
1) Now(E$_x$) is a group of multiple abstract points 
2) Now(E$_x$) is a singular abstract point
We want to show that there is difference in E$_x$

**Option 1:**
Option 1 trivially entails difference via the concept of area understood as "group of abstract points". If the different points where exactly the same in all regards and had no difference it would just mean that there isn't a group of multiple points and instead there is only a single point being miss conceptualized as group of multiple points. 
So if we assume now to be a group of points this means Now(E$_x$) has difference.

**Clarification** 
As humans not as DS we perform the following thought exercise.
We assume the following
	1) E$_x$ takes 5s
	2) E$_x$ takes 10s
We can differentiate this cases because we introduced time as an external metric. However a DS doesn't have access to this external metric. It is in a state without time and therefore 1) and 2) are exactly the same.
If 1 and 2 weren't exactly the same despite being identically in experience this would mean that the DS could in some manner track abstract duration of experience (implying observable difference in experience) if this were the case the Now(E$_x$) would not be a point and rather a group of points. Meaning now has difference.
To truly understand Now(E$_x$) as a point we have to understand the same experience as being contained in this point.
This reflection is relevant since to prevent us from uttering statements like "What if this experience was eternal/always the case" since we are able to understand that this thoughts are distractions that collapse into either Now(E$_x$) being a group of points or it leads to Now(E$_x$) still being a single Point for the DS. Therefore trying to describe Now(E$_x$) as eternal is meaningless for the DS.
Since we want to derive difference or change implied by now happening it is important to highlight that objections that lead to the same derivation are functionally void.
	
**Option 2**
We can try to analyze if Now(E$_x$) is a point by asking if Now(E$_x$) entails change.
If there is change in E$_x$ this means 
	
The only possible way to conceptualize Now(E$_x$) as a point requires experience to be a static (collapsed eternally present) thing without difference, change or arisal leads to a construction of a static "experience" that just is and always is. But this description is not what we mean when we talk of experience. If someone chooses to describe *this experience* as always the same (eternal) one and only thing there is then what this person is describing is static existence and has nothing in common with what I (and presumably many others) want to express when speaking of experience.
Crucially the concepts of now as a abstract location breaks. There would so to speak just be the experience and speaking of now would be empty and nonsensical. Further also the concept of being aware breaks if we conceptualize a experience as just always being the case without difference there is nothing that being aware actually expresses. It's just empty terminology. And further a subject that just always is in a state of *this (one same) experience* can't reasonably be conceptualized as subject. So what we would end up is just one eternal fact of the matter and not an ES.
