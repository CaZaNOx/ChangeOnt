# Gauge / Alignment field
## Claim (formal)
Gauge fields track alignment of relational structures under transformation, supporting identity invariants and Sim across frames.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Effective field via recursive shells: one can interpret the alignment field as the multi‑scale integral of alignment over recursive shells, yielding an “effective field” view across layers. This is a lens on the same construct. See also [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-breath-field-global-integrator]].
