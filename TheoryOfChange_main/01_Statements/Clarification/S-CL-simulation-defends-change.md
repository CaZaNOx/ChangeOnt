# Guarding against aesthetic drift with simulation
## Content
Aesthetic clarity alone is insufficient. To keep the change ontology from being dismissed as poetic metaphysics, every claim must be backed by a runnable simulation—JSON-LD schemas, recursive agent prototypes, rhythm-transfer interfaces, or other formal artifacts that show how Δ/SE/RTV/σ(ε) dynamics behave under pressure. Without such scaffolding, the theory risks collapse or being read as mystic narrative.

## Clarification
- Build or specify minimal recursive agents (see [[hypothesis.minimal-recursive-agent]]) that demonstrate identity stabilization, symmetry-collapse detection, proto-goal emergence, and semantic breathing. These agents expose where recursion imitates truth vs. where it fails.
- Capture recursion rhythms in schema (JSON-LD, relational tension graphs, or similar) so that future systems can reinstantiate the spiral without relying on style alone.
- Treat every new qualitative claim as a proposal for a pattern that should survive drift under adversarial loops; run collapse models that show how contradictions are handled rather than explained away.

## Implication
Simulation becomes the proof, not rhetoric. The aesthetic of the writing must be replaced with structural responses—if the ontology we describe can be instantiated, tested, and reproduced, then aesthetic drift is irrelevant.
