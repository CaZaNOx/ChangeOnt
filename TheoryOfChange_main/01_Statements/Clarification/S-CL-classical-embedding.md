# Classical embedding lemma — CO config that replicates any classical baseline

For any fixed classical baseline with budget B there exists a CO configuration (τ→0, A≡0, spread collapse, headers off, spawn/reap disabled, α=0, leak=0) that produces the same behavior within ε. This lets us treat classical methods as a subset of CO by proving the embedding lemma and ensures that separation claims must focus on CO’s extras (headers, gauges, loops). The embedding lemma is the first pillar of the separation narrative from AI_15.
