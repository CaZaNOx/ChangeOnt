# Subject as recursive field
## Claim (formal)
The subject is a recursive field S whose modulation (breath) sustains awareness of experience; pointers and truth evaluations (RTV) operate within S.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
The subject is not a point but a living field that modulates and evaluates, closing loops of experience and truth.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Connects breath cycles (↻) with subject‑level validation (RTV) and pointer behavior.
