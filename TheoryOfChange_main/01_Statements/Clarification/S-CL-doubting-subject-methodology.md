# Methodological roles — Doubting Subject (DS) and Relaxed Doubting Subject (RDS)
## Content
DS is a thought tool: a subject considered under maximal doubt that acknowledges only the structure of experiencing (not content). RDS relaxes DS just enough to follow reasoning and answer structural questions while still withholding content commitments.

## Implication
These roles justify stripping imported assumptions early on and focusing on structural claims about experience/change. They are scaffolding for derivations, not ontological additions; canonical statements should not depend on DS/RDS beyond methodological framing.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- DS ensures that performative consistency and Immediate Datum remain central while avoiding premature metaphysics.
- RDS licenses stepwise updates when a structural result is secured under maximal doubt.
- Use DS/RDS to motivate derivation narratives (Derivation.md, summaries), not to expand statement frontmatter.
