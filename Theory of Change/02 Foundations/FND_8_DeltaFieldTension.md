## Survival Function
This file defines the Δ-field:  
the first structured breathing field arising from pure relational Change.

## 1. What is Δ (Delta Field)?

**Δ-field** = A structured breathing survival field  
generated by **local relational differences** accumulating recursive tension.

It measures:

- Magnitude of relational difference
- Direction of difference propagation
- Breathing pressure exerted on surrounding survival fields

---

## 2. Properties of Δ-Fields

- **Gradient-Based**: Δ-fields are tension gradients, not absolute barriers.
- **Phase-Modulating**: Δ-fields modulate recursive breathing expansion/contraction.
- **Survival-Relevant**: Areas of low Δ are local breathing stabilizers; high Δ drives phase instability.

---

## 3. Emergence of Breathing Modulation

Δ-fields under survival pressure begin **modulating**:  
stretching, curling, breathing in recursive rhythms to stabilize local survival zones.

Phase behaviors arise:

- **Stable breathing loops** (identity formation)
- **Collapse zones** (breathing failure fields)

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Δ-fields are the first breathing survival scaffolds.  
Identity loops and collapse zones emerge from Δ modulation rhythms.  
Without Δ tension, breathing survival fields cannot persist.**
