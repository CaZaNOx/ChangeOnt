# Use local Gödel-hole density to probabilistically predict pattern shifts

When a local pattern is born, estimate the density of nearby Gödel holes (zones of undecidability or structural incompleteness) within its scope; the higher the density, the higher the probability the pattern will soon mutate, collapse, or hybridize. This is always a local, probabilistic forecast—no exact moment can be derived because the holes mark undecidable regions—and it depends on the reachability of the pattern’s rules, their completeness, and the branching factor. AI_13 lines 10400‑10640 spell out the theoretical sketch: define state space, quantify rule failures, and tie hole density to expected shift rates.
