structurallyPointsTo (⇘):=
"x⇘y" means: x is a structural prior of y that, by virtue of being pointed at, enables the arisal of y as different.
This is not a causal or temporal arrow, but a structural precondition for newness at y.
(x⇘y):= x points to y as implied by the structural ability of pointing in y. Put differently we say $\exists y: (Arisal(y))$ and $Arisal(y)\implies \exists x:(Prior(x))$
