# CO core is a pipeline from primitives to gates + variant sweep

CO must be described as a pipeline: primitives (density, entropy, loopiness) feed diagnostics, diagnostics feed gates (collapse, merge, headers), and gates emit actions plus compute budgets. Each part must be specified before tuning, and variant switches (H0-H3 agents) reuse the same knobs across tasks, as AI_17 emphasizes. This is the gap-free framework you asked for: derived bricks (diagnostics → gate) combine into a full CO core, ready to be evaluated via the preregistered grids/seeds.
