# Summaries — Grouped Overviews of Core Content

Purpose
- Provide concise, Obsidian‑friendly overviews for major clusters in the theory.
- Help readers navigate statements and concepts without replacing canonical files.

Conventions
- Each summary lists scope, core nodes (statements/concepts), key takeaways, and open items.
- Links point to canonical statements in `01_Statements` and relevant concept pages.

Contained summaries
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-Foundations]] — core foundations (FT/early DF/CR)
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-PointerReachTx]] — pointer, reach, locality, depth, Tx
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-Identity]] — identity, similarity, thresholds, SE, entropy
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-Subject-Consciousness]] — subject triad, self‑model, consciousness loop, inter‑subject gauge
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-Godel-Limits]] — Gödel holes, limits, protocols
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-Logic-Math]] — co‑logic, quantale logic, composition
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-Gauge-HAQ-Stabilization]] — gauge/Γ,K, HAQ, breath stabilization
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-Benchmarks-Audit]] — indicators, audit, benchmarks, predictive statements
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-PRM-ELM-OPS]] — primitives, elements, operators overview
- [[06_Summaries/SUM-Derivation-Graph]] — reading the derivation DAG
