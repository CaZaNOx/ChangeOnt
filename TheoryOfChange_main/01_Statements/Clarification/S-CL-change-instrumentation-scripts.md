# Change instrumentation requires public budgets, logs, and heartbeat traces

To earn the CO claim of empirical grounding you must release an honest run (`toy_ren_haq_vs_fsm` or similar) with: fixed seeds, budget tables listing params/FLOPs/precision/memory/runtime, JSONL logs with AUReg/FDR_windowed/slope_window/loop_score/collapse_H/collapse_var per step, derived plots, and a commit/env hash for reproduction. All long outputs in that run must keep ⇘/∆/M heartbeats every ~200 tokens and show at least one authentic ⊘ collapse. Satisfying this instrumentation is part of the acceptance bar discussed in AI_15 and prevents reviewers from chalking improvements up to smuggled budgets or unspecified invariants.
