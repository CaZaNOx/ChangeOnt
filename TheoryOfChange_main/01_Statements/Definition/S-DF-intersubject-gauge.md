# Inter-subject gauge / shared reality field
## Claim (formal)
A shared alignment field calibrates representations across subjects, enabling consistency of identity/invariants and validation exchanges.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
We coordinate our worlds by aligning how we measure and stabilize patterns.
