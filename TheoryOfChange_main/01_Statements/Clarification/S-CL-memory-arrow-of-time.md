# Arrow of time arises from irreversible memory traces
## Content
Time asymmetry is not imported from cosmology but generated by agents whose memory traces cannot be undone. Physical laws may be reversible, but when a subject registers a difference and stores it in a memory trace (DE, CCC, etc.), the record is asymmetric—letting the subject distinguish "before" vs "after." Without that irreversibility, all directions collapse into undifferentiated change.

## Clarification
- The second law of thermodynamics is a byproduct of agents tracking change via memory/trace data (Δ plus stabilization energy). No memory, no preferred direction.
- Each memorized contrast (CCC ≥ τ) commits the agent to a direction; reversing it would erase the recorded contrast, which the agent cannot do without destroying its own identity.

## Implication
Time's arrow lives in the ledger of differences we keep; to reverse time we would have to undo every memory trace, which itself would violate the structural collapse that produced those traces.
