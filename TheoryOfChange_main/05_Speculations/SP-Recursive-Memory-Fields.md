# Recursive Memory Fields — breathing phase imprints over cycles
Summary:
Memory conceived as Δ‑phase imprints stabilized by SE and maintained by attention/temporal ops.

Why speculative:
Qualitative taxonomy (phase-indexed snapshots) rather than a compact formalism.

Recommended next step:
Express as stateful operators over traces with clear EMA/decay; add CR on drift/SE interplay.
