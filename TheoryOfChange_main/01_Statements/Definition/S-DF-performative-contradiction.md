# Performative Contradiction — denying P enacts P
## Claim (formal)
If asserting ¬P necessarily enacts P, then ¬P is self‑defeating; P holds under performative consistency.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
If saying “not P” depends on P being true to make sense, then P is true. Some denials are self‑defeating because the act of denying re‑instates what is denied (like using language to claim language is impossible, or changing your mind to claim change is unreal).

## Philosophical Justification
Speech acts and cognition are themselves events. When an act of denial presupposes what it denies (e.g., denying change while changing), the denial cannot coherently succeed. This pushes us to analyze claims not only propositionally but operationally: What does one have to do to make the claim? If the performance re‑creates the very condition it rejects, the content collapses under its own enactment. Performative contradiction is thus an experiential consistency check that complements formal logic.

## Explanation (informal)
This provides the consistency test grounding the Immediate Datum and other foundational claims.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- Schema intuition: denying X while presupposing X cannot succeed; the denial collapses into affirmation.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```math
\text{If } A(\lnot P) \Rightarrow P \;\; \text{then } P.
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- corollary: [[S-FT-immediate-datum]]

## Clarifications / Further Context
- “Requires(P)” captures presuppositions of the act; it is not merely material implication.
