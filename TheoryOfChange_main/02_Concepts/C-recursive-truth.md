# Recursive Truth and Breath
Overview:
Truth is evaluated under recursive cycles (↻) that detect, modulate, and validate under changing conditions (ε, σ(ε)). Recursive Truth Value (RTV) tracks stability across cycles rather than assuming single‑pass verification. For probabilistic phrasing, see [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-structural-recurrence-likelihood]] and [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-evaluation-surface]]. For perceived time and attention mentions, use [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-perceived-time-breath-index]] and [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-attention-recursive-filter]].

Clarification note:
Use SRL/Evaluation Surface framing instead of probability language for stability across cycles; see [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-structural-recurrence-likelihood]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-evaluation-surface]], and the clarification [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-probabilistic-language-srl]]. Mentions of “attention” should be understood as a recursive prioritization filter, not a spatial spotlight; see [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-attention-recursive-filter]].
