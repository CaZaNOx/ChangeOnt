# Hard jumps require Gödel closures; soft jumps are mere reorganizations

Not every emergence is a Gödel closure. Soft jumps (physics→chemistry→biology) reorganize and compress prior detail but remain, in principle, accessible to downward analysis; the underlying layer survives in the new logic. Hard jumps—like the hypothesized universe origin or perhaps consciousness—are Gödel closures: they resolve an undecidable contradiction by introducing new primitives, irreversibly compressing micro-details, and creating new invariants. Claiming to deduce the prior layer from a hard jump violates Gödel/Turing limits; honest ontology marks the boundary of predictability instead. This distinction keeps the theory grounded in mathematical and physical irreversibility as AI_13 lines 12070‑12136 insist.
