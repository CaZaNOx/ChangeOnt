# Primitive — Gauge (history-adaptive alignment transport)
## Claim (formal)
Choose a connection Γ minimizing local tension mismatch Δτ across neighbors, yielding a transport that preserves learned coherence and induces an emergent metric.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Coherence comes from learning how to carry comparisons from place to place without tearing the pattern.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Feeds HAQ and stabilization; exposes curvature K as a coherence signal.
