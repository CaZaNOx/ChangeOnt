# Map Gödel holes via ledgered audits and emergent regions

Define Gödel holes as structural gaps where pointer/closure protocols fail; map them by logging each unclosable difference, its trigger, the minimal missing element, and the context. Visualize them as nodes in a conceptual graph whose edges indicate pointer events or attempted closures, so that the map highlights the zones where new variables, frames, or dimensions must emerge. This map is your guide to mutation and tells successor agents where to expect necessary expansions, as AI_13 lines 1100‑1185 describe.
