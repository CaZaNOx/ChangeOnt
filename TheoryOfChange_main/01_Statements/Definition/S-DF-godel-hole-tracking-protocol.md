# Gödel hole tracking protocol
## Claim (formal)
Log GH with fields: location (Lstart-Lend), concept context, required operator (e.g., Tx), attempted resolutions, current status, next review date.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
We don’t hide gaps — we name them, give them a home, and revisit them until resolved.

## Pseudocode
```text
def log_GH(step, concept, needed):
  registry.append({ locus: step, concept, needed, status: open, next: schedule() })
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- GH registry lives alongside statements; review is part of breath.
