# Root — Minimal Ontic Stance
## Claim (formal)
Adopt a minimal stance allowing only what is strictly unavoidable from experience and self-reference; no extra metaphysics assumed.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Start from only what cannot be reasonably denied in experience; add nothing beyond that. We suspend heavier metaphysical commitments until they are earned by necessity. The stance is: remain with what shows itself as undeniable, then allow further structure to arise under pressure of coherence.

## Philosophical Justification
To avoid circularity and drift, begin from the least‑assumptive position that still permits articulation of experience. This commits us only to what cannot be denied without contradiction. If we import rich ontologies too soon (substances, essences, absolute time), we risk smuggling in answers to questions we have not yet posed. A minimal stance constrains us to earn those resources by demonstrating where the current structure collapses without them. This is not anti‑metaphysical; it is disciplined metaphysics: any added postulate must either be forced by performative consistency or demonstrably improve the explanatory unity of the system without creating hidden dependencies.

## Explanation (informal)
This node serves as a parent for foundational statements derived from immediate experience and performative consistency.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- Methodological axiom: prefer minimal commitments that survive performative tests.
- Any thicker metaphysics risks importing assumptions not yet justified by Δ-based reasoning.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Not applicable — methodological root (no prior premises to derive from).
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- corollary: [[S-CR-no-null-world]] (follows from adopting Immediate Datum as first commitment)

## Clarifications / Further Context
- This statement sets guardrails for the entire derivation chain; it is not itself a theorem.
- It licenses using performative consistency as a primary filter.

## Next Steps in Chain
- suggest: [[S-DF-performative-contradiction]]
- suggest: [[S-FT-immediate-datum]]

## Notes
- Provides a common parent for early FT/DF items.
