# Primitive — Residuation (implication-as-effort) in a residuated quantale
## Claim (formal)
In a (residuated) quantale (L, ≤, ⊕, ⊗) with min‑join ⊕ and composition ⊗, define residual a ⇒ b as the greatest x with a ⊗ x ≤ b. Equivalently: a ⊗ x ≤ b ⇔ x ≤ a ⇒ b. This interprets “how much more effort is needed” to reach b after a.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Implication is “what remains to be done.” If a gets you partway, residuation measures the extra lift to achieve b.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Supports policy heads (cost gaps), routing proofs, and J‑operators with guarantees.
