# Quantale → Boolean flattening — proof sketch via idempotent collapse

Philosophical Derivation

When evidence is graded and compositional, a quantale (complete lattice + monoidal composition ⊗ distributing over arbitrary joins) models aggregation and chaining of support. Boolean logic appears as a degenerate regime where all non-bottom elements are identified as “true enough” (idempotent collapse). This is a pragmatic convention: once costs collapse to a strict cut, residual distinctions vanish and only entailment structure remains.

Formal/Operational Derivation

Let (Q, ≤, ⊗, ⊕) be a unital quantale with ⊕ the join (e.g., min-plus or max-plus variants after order reversal). Define a quotient map π: Q → B by selecting a threshold θ and setting π(x) = 1 iff x ≥ θ, else 0, with 0 < θ ≤ ⊤. Then for any family {x_i}:

1) π(⊕_i x_i) = 1 iff ∃i: x_i ≥ θ = ⊕_i π(x_i) in Boolean join.
2) π(x ⊗ y) = 1 iff x ⊗ y ≥ θ. Choose θ with closure: if x ≥ θ and y ≥ θ then x ⊗ y ≥ θ (monotonicity). Then π respects composition: π(x ⊗ y) = π(x) ∧ π(y).

Thus π is a quantale homomorphism to the Boolean algebra B when θ is admissible (upward closed and multiplicatively stable). Boolean logic is the flattened image; loss of grading is explicit, not mysterious.

Clarifications

- This does not posit Boolean foundations; it exhibits Boolean reasoning as a coarse projection of graded evidential calculus.
- Choosing θ is application-dependent; see [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-evaluation-surface]].
