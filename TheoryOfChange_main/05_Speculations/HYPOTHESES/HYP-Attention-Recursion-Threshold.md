# Hypothesis — Minimal recursion threshold for attention formation
Proposal
- Identify minimal recursion depth/lock frequency needed for stable attention formation (as recursive prioritization) to persist under breath.

Test sketch
- Vary recursion depth/lock frequency; measure stability of attention schedules and their impact on RTV.
