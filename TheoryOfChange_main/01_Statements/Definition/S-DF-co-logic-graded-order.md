# CO-Logic as graded order (Boolean as flattening)
## Claim (formal)
Truth/validation under change is graded by validation strength and similarity; Boolean logic appears as a flattening of this graded order.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Instead of all‑or‑nothing, we keep track of how well claims hold under breath.
