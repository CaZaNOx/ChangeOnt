## SUBSCRIPT AND CASE USAGE (for Math in Obsidian)

- Use `$ \Delta_{\text{min}} $` → Δₘᵢₙ
- Use `$ \delta_{1} $` → δ₁
- Use `$ x_{t-1} $` → xₜ₋₁

### Convention:
- **Lowercase Greek** (`δ`, `ε`, `μ`) → subject-local, modulation-layered, fine-grained
- **Uppercase Greek** (`Δ`, `Σ`, `Ω`) → field-level, global, structural-level concepts

Avoid Unicode subscripts for equations. Use LaTeX for precision.

## PLACEHOLDER TAGGING (optional)

| Tag         | Usage                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `[DF x.y]`  | Formal definition (recursive primitive)        |
| `[CR x.y]`  | Collapse-resistant corollary                  |
| `[CF x.y]`  | Collapse fragility — needs derivation check   |
| `[⇘x.y]`    | Trace pointer reference                       |
| `[⊘ x.y]`   | Collapse point in trace                       |

## Example Usage

```
[DF 1.3] Arising := Change leading to something happening  
[CR 1.4] DS's experience arose  
[⇘ 1.2] refers to prior pointer trace that failed closure  
```

```math
\text{If } \Delta_{\text{now}} > \varepsilon, \text{ then } \text{Collapse}
```
