# Element — EE — Compressibility (robustness predictor)
## Claim (formal)
Estimate robustness via compressibility signals (e.g., LZ/MDL proxy) with temporal smoothing; emit robustness_pred and counts.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
If it compresses, it likely endures.

## Philosophical Justification
Persistent patterns are compressible: they repeat structure in ways that concise descriptions can capture. LZ/MDL proxies provide an operational signal of regularity and thus robustness to noise/drift. Temporal smoothing (EMA) avoids chasing transient coincidences and respects breath pacing.

## Derivation (Formal/Operational)
```text
lz_count_t := LZ(x_{1..t})
robustness_pred := EMA(robustness_pred, f(lz_count_t))
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Compressibility is one lens; combine with identity/SE for a balanced view.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Benchmark compressibility signals against SRL/SE in target domains.
