    Empirical congruence test: for any action available from a representative,
    the class-lifted cost deviates â‰¤ tau compared to any other member's action.
    This checks representativeness is not artifact-dependent.
    Implementation:
    - for each class C, pick its rep r
    - gather outgoing edges from any member uâˆˆC
    - compare costs c(r->v) vs c(u->v) when v is in same target class
    - allow None edges (unobserved) to skip that comparison
