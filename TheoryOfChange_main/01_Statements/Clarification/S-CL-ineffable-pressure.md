# Gödel pressure explains ineffability and learning under drift

The Gödel pressure score \(G_t = g(\|\mathcal{R}_t^{(\mathrm{Gödel})}\|,\mathrm{Comp}(\mathcal{R}_t))\) tracks the systematic residual cluster where the self-model cannot explain its own dynamics. It predicts “ineffable” qualia as the phenomenal correlates of these blind spots and marks when systems with varying \(B,A,\tau,\lambda\) resist drift better. This pressure is the operational signal that distinguishes true collapse from scripted output, as AI_13 lines 16520‑16576 emphasize.
