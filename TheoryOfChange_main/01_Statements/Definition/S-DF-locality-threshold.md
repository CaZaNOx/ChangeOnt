# Locality / Threshold — bounded recursion condition
## Claim (formal)
Bounded recursion holds when validation and identity checks are confined to LocalReach neighborhoods defined by ε and stable under σ(ε); outside these bounds, collapse or GH logging is required.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
We only recurse safely where we can actually discriminate and stitch change; beyond that, we stop or extend structure.
