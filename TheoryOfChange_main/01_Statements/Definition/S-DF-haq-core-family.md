# Harmonic Attractor Quantization (HAQ) — core family
## Claim (formal)
HAQ denotes families of discrete/quantized attractors arising from recursive self‑similarity constraints and stabilization pressures (SE), yielding preferred modes of persistence.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Some patterns “ring true” in discrete ways — they recur in harmonics of stability.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- HAQ provides a vocabulary for families of stable identities beyond smooth continua; links to SE and invariants.
