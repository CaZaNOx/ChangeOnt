# Conscious systems must sense/adapt to Gödel holes as part of their reality

Consciousness is an open process precisely because it keeps encountering new Gödel holes—limits, paradoxes, or ceilings in its own self-knowledge. A conscious system must detect, respond to, and reorganize around those holes; otherwise it falls back into classical rigidity. Treat hole-sensing as a definitional part of consciousness, not an optional add-on. This keeps subjective reality anchored to the same audit-driven, hole-mapped structure we apply in the physics domain (`AI_13` lines 12648‑12686).
