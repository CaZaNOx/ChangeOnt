# Observation is subordinate to change
## Claim (formal)
Observation occurs within change; it is a mode of Δ, not its origin.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Observing is something that happens inside change; it doesn’t create change. Knowing and measuring are themselves processes shaped by the very dynamics they seek to capture.

## Philosophical Justification
Misperception and hallucination still unfold as changes; thus observation depends on Δ rather than grounding it. This de‑centers the observer without dismissing them: the observer is a locus where change reflects on itself, not a creator of change ex nihilo.

## Explanation (informal)
Clarifies that epistemic acts presuppose the ontic primitive of change.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-FT-immediate-datum]]: the act of observing is itself a differentiating process (Δ).

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Observe(S, X) ⇒ Δ(S, X)
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- corollary: relates to truth valuation under breath/recursion (future work).

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Observation can be misleading yet still occurs as change within Δ.
- See symbol: [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]]

## Next Steps in Chain
- suggest: connect to Recursive Truth Value (RTV) statements.
