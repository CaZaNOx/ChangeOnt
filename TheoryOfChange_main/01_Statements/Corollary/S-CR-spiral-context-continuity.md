# Spiral adjacency supports contextual continuity under LocalReach
## Statement (corollary)
When breath sustains spiral recursion, adjacent arms remain within LocalReach bands, maintaining contextual continuity while progressing; pure circles (no progress) and lines (no context) are degenerate regimes.

## Justification from definitions
- LocalReach/Depth define neighborhoods around Now; spiral adjacency keeps successive cycles within overlapping bands.
- Breath integrates cycles so validation operates coherently across arms.
