# Gauge notes guard against smuggling classical discreteness

Whenever prose mentions a finite graph, tick, point, or similar classical structure, prepend an explicit gauge note clarifying that the description is a representational convenience built over the current reach/sequences, not a claim about ontology. The gauge note should flag the specific knot of detection thresholds (Δ-floor/ceiling) that permits that convenience and remind readers that the object in question lives in the act-relative residue field. This keeps the FND build from surreptitiously reintroducing classical discreteness as a primitive.
