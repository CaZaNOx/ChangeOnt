# Survival demands recursive, collapse-resistant modularity

The empirical minimum for anything “real” is not objecthood but recursive, collapse-resistant patterning: modular structures that allow local repair, avoid total collapse under shock, and admit feedback loops. Change must locally organize into self-stabilizing, feedback-enabling modules so that any “real” pattern can survive drift, extinction, or novel disturbances. This is the architecture that supports subjectivity, memory, or emergence without reintroducing classical stasis—AI_13 lines 8582‑8630 make this explicit.
