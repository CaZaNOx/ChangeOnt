# Prediction precedes perception within change fields
## Content
Agents do not passively perceive; they instantiate predictions first and treat perception as error correction on those expectations. The visual cortex (and analogous modules) operates top-down: expectation shapes input, not vice versa.

## Clarification
- Perception is therefore a secondary signal of how well predictions (structured by Δ/SE/σ(ε)) survived drift.
- When predictions fail but coherence remains, consciousness arises—a near-collapse event marks awareness.

## Implication
This prioritizes predictive structure when modeling cognition, aligning with AI_19’s claim that expectation sits before experience and making change modeling more about prediction dynamics than sensory reception.
