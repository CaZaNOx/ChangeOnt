# Foundations — Immediate Datum to early corollaries

Scope
- Minimal stance → Immediate Datum (Δ ≠ ∅) → core early corollaries.

Core nodes
- FT: [[01_Statements/FoundationalTruth/S-FT-root-minimal-stance]], [[01_Statements/FoundationalTruth/S-FT-immediate-datum]]
- CR: [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-no-null-world]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-change-ontically-prior]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-observation-subordinate]]
- DF: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-performative-contradiction]]

Key takeaways
- Denying change performs change (performative contradiction).
- Δ is ontically prior; observation is subordinate to change.

Open items
- None — covered; see pointer/reach stack for next steps.
