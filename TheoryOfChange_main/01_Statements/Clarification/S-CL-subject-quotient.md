# Subject as quotient of noticing, order, and minimal memory
## Content
The subject emerges not from a pre-given entity but as a quotient: it is the structural residue after we analyze (i) the minimal comparator that notices change, (ii) the ordering that distinguishes now from just-before-now, and (iii) the memory witness that links one jump to the next. The subject is therefore the ratio of noticing-plus-order against the silence of no contrast.

## Clarification
- DF S.1 (Subject as quotient) refers to the full subject only in proportion to its successful detection of ordered differences plus minimal memory. If either contrast or memory collapses, the ratio vanishes and the subject reduces to a smaller locus.
- This protects the “start with change” promise: no subject is assumed, only this emergent quotient once the minimal witnesses align.

## Implication
This reinterpretation keeps the subject tethered to observable edges (contrast/testable memory), preventing circular definitions and ensuring the subject’s identity is traceable to change operations.
