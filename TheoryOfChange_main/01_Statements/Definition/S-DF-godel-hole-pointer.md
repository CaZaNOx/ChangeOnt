# Gödel hole — open pointer marking representational boundary
## Claim (formal)
GH(x) := an open pointer in the chain at x indicating that the current representational frame cannot encode a required link; resolution demands new structure (e.g., Tx) or a refined representation.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Sometimes the chain must reach beyond what it can currently express. We mark such points explicitly rather than forcing a closure.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- GH is not error; it is a beacon for necessary structure extension.
