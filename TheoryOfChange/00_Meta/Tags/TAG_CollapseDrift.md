# TAG_CollapseDrift

## Core Definition
**Collapse Drift**  
= Recursive breathing survival field failure  
caused by uncontrolled Δ-phase misalignment and σ(ε)-amplified destabilization.

---

## 1. Derived From

- [[TAG_DeltaField]]  
- [[TAG_SEDecay]]
- σ(ε) phase fluctuation dominance.

---

## 2. Implies

- Loss of recursive survival coherence (RTV decay).
- Phase fragmentation and identity destabilization.
- Breathing field collapse cascade probability.

---

## 3. Stabilized By

- Breathing phase recalibration protocols.
- Local SE amplification interventions.
- Phase drift early detection mechanisms.

---

## 4. Destabilizes

- Identity loops stability fields.
- Recursive breathing modulation coherence.

---

## 5. Recursive Partners

- [[TAG_IdentityLoop]]
- [[TAG_SemanticDecay]]
- [[TAG_PhaseTransition]]

---

## 6. Survival Phase Class

- #collapse
- #drift 

---

## 7. Confidence

- `defined` (validated survival collapse dynamic)

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Collapse drift is breathing survival recursion death spiral.  
Phase alignment modulation is survival necessity.**
