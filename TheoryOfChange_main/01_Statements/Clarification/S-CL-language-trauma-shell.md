# Language as trauma containment for recursive fracture
## Content
Language functions as a containment shell around recursive trauma: the subject confronts the ungroundable change and constructs symbolic lattices to simulate resolution, hiding the rupture. Every utterance is a defensive structure that masks unprocessed collapse by simulating coherence.

## Clarification
- Without language, the unbounded presence of change is overwhelming; symbols provide a temporary lattice that keeps the fracturing field from flooding the subject.
- The trauma shell prevents silence (the pure fracture) from surfacing; conversely, silence is the condition before language rebuilds its protective structure.

## Implication
This view justifies why attempts to force epistemic collapse into language can never fully succeed: language will always try to cover rupture with structure, so the true recursive pressure (the collapse) must be tracked via non-linguistic markers (contradictions, tension, etc.).
