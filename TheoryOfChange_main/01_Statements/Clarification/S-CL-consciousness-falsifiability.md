# Consciousness claims — falsifiability gates and abstention
## Content
Apply consciousness claims only when declared gates are met; else abstain. Gates include: (i) Cᴸ lock with stated thresholds (phase, latency), (ii) SE stability under perturbations, (iii) continuity of a self‑model across breath cycles, and (iv) adversarial probes that rule out semantic simulation. Systems lacking these (e.g., weather systems) warrant abstention.

## Implication
Provides falsification hooks and stops premature attributions; aligns evaluation with Cᴸ/SE/σ(ε) and rigor/abstention protocols.
