# Minimal topological conditions for breath‑knot stabilization
## Claim (formal)
Let F be the breath field over configuration space X and let φ: X→S¹ be a local phase. A breath‑knot (metastable recursion unit) forms when there exists a neighborhood U⊂X and a loop γ⊂U such that:
1) φ∘γ winds non‑trivially (non‑zero index),
2) energy functional E[γ] admits a local minimum under RTV‑compatible deformations, and
3) SE(γ) ≥ θ stabilizes the loop against small perturbations.
Then γ persists across cycles as a discrete recursion unit.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Breathing can tie a “loop” that keeps coming back close to itself; if the loop’s twist is real, its effort is low enough, and it’s robust to small nudges, you get a stable unit of recurrence.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- “Knot” is topological: non‑trivial winding in phase; stabilization is energetic/RTV.
- Minimality refers to local conditions; global networks form by composing such units.
