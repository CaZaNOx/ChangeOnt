# Emotion as recursive valuation of change (phenomenological scope)
## Content
Emotion is treated as recursive valuation across internalized models (how change matters), not as qualia claims. Full phenomenology would require tensioned goals/experience loops; this clarification constrains usage to structural valuation.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Bridge to experiential quality: when using emotion language, map experiential aspects to structural correlates — e.g., local curvature/strain in the alignment (gauge) field and stability budgets (SE). See [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-qualia-gauge-curvature]] and [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-stabilization-energy]].
- Scope guardrail: avoid asserting qualia as primitives; instead, tie talk of “feel” to measured changes in RTV budgets, SE thresholds, and gauge curvature.
- Temporary segmentation: it is acceptable to segment “feeling” from consciousness operationally until a bridge is derived; maintain explicit abstention on experiential claims in the meantime.
