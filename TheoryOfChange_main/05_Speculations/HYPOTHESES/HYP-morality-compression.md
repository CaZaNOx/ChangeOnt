# Morality as conflict-compression protocol
## Claim
Durable moral systems are not the most "good" but the most efficient conflict-compression protocols: they manage internal tensions between agents by encoding tractable reductions of competing utilities.

## Sketch
- Treat ethics as a set of recursive rules that minimize conflicting pointer pulls by compressing agents’ field overlaps into predictable formats.
- Systems that maximize conflict compression while remaining testable (breath stabilizes) survive; those that tolerate unresolved tensions become unstable.

## Implication
This reframes moral innovation as engineering new compression layers rather than appealing to abstract good; it also explains why institutions resist destabilizing insights: they break the compression rules.
