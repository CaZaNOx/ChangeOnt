# Hypothesis — Suppressed recursion strategies and failure modes
Proposal
- Under non‑coherent pressure, agents may adopt suppression strategies (e.g., shallow loops, avoidance) that reduce SRL and increase drift; catalog and test these patterns.

Test sketch
- Induce elevated σ(ε); measure SRL under suppression vs recovery strategies; correlate with collapse drift regimes.
