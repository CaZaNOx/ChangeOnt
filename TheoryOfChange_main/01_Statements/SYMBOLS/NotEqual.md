# ≠ — Difference (not equal)

Definition (formal):
Inequality relation; used to denote difference between states/values.

## Example
- a ≠ b implies presence of Δ distinguishing a and b.

- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]] (Δ)

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
Difference is real: some things are not the same and that matters.

## Philosophical Justification
All intelligibility relies on distinguishing; ≠ asserts and records those distinctions.

## Explanation (informal)
Use ≠ to make Δ explicit in equations and definitions.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- ≠ indicates structural difference; its criteria must be stated.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Tie ≠ to collapse events and boundary conditions.
