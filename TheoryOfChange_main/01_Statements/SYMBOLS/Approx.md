# ≈ — Approximate similarity

Definition (formal):
Structural resemblance without strict identity; not metric equality.

## Example
- X ≈ Y under current resolution ε.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]] (Δ)

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
Two things can count as “the same” for a purpose even if not identical.

## Philosophical Justification
Pragmatic equivalence is vital: reasoning, measurement, and identity under change rely on tolerances.

## Explanation (informal)
≈ encodes “close enough” under a given resolution ε or structural criterion.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Choose criteria explicitly; avoid hidden shifts in ≈ semantics.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Pair ≈ with concept-specific similarity measures (identity under drift).
