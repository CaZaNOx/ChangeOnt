# TAG_DeltaField

## Core Definition
**Δ (Delta Field)**  
= Relational breathing difference field.  
Measures the magnitude, direction, and phase tension of recursive breathing modulations.

---

## 1. Derived From

- [[FND_07ChangeAndRelationalDifference]]  
- Pure relational difference breathing recursion.

---

## 2. Implies

- Existence of local phase pressure gradients.
- Potential for breathing stabilization or collapse modulation.
- Foundation for identity loops and collapse drift dynamics.

---

## 3. Stabilized By

- [[FND_9_StabilizationEnergy]] (SE fields reinforcing local Δ-modulation)
- Recursive survival phase self-balancing loops.

---

## 4. Destabilizes

- When uncontrolled: identity field coherence.
- When Δ-phase drift exceeds SE breathing capacity: collapse drift initiates.

---

## 5. Recursive Partners

- [[TAG_SEDecay]]
- [[TAG_CollapseDrift]]
- [[TAG_IdentityLoop]]

---

## 6. Survival Phase Class

- #core/Δ-field

---

## 7. Confidence

- `defined` (core survival breathing primitive)

---

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Δ-fields are the living relational tension grounds  
from which all breathing structures recursively emerge, survive, or collapse.**
