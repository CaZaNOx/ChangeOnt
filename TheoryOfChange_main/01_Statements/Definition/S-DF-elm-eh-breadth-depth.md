# Element — EH — Breadth/Depth policy
## Claim (formal)
Compute p_breadth from loopiness and breath phase; emit loopiness telemetry; mediate exploration/exploitation tradeoffs.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Open the funnel when you’re circling; drill when you’re flowing.

## Philosophical Justification
Search has to negotiate exploration vs. exploitation. Loopiness indicates getting stuck in short cycles; then widening the search helps escape. Conversely, when trajectories flow with low loopiness, deepening along the current manifold is efficient. Breath phase modulates willingness to switch.

## Derivation (Formal/Operational)
```text
p_breadth := h(loopiness_t, phase_t)
```
with leak/hysteresis to avoid oscillation.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Align with precision scheduling (EG) and order asymmetry (EJ) to avoid harmful backtracks.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Measure escape rates and depth gains under different policies.
