# Stable structures emerge from recursive amplification of local differences

In regions where no structure yet exists, change seeds structure through fleeting fluctuations that, by chance or recursion, reinforce themselves. These micro-differences grow via positive feedback, are retained when they persist longer than alternatives, propagate influence, and layer into nested stabilizations—all while remaining provisional. Each stage (diffusion → feedback → retention → propagation → layering) is a recursive field event, not a pre-imposed plan, so stability is always local, contingent, and ready for transformation, as AI_13 explains in lines 6000‑6200.
