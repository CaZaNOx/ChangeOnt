# Primitive — Bend metric (local deviation from self-continuation)
## Claim (formal)
The bend τ of a segment quantifies deviation from its gauge‑aligned continuation. Given predicted continuation p(x) and realized y, τ := gauge_norm(p(x), y). Lower τ indicates coherent self‑continuation; higher τ indicates effort/curvature.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
“Effort” is how much a trajectory must bend away from what it would have done to remain itself.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Serves as a base cost for stabilization, routing, and motif selection.
- Links to emergent curvature under the history‑adaptive gauge (HAQ).
