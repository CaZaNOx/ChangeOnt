# Meaning as residue of near-collapse (interpretation)
## Content
On this reading, “meaning” tracks structures that nearly collapse but stabilize: interpretation survives as residue from tensions resolved short of failure.

## Implication
Provides a heuristic for interpreting stabilization artifacts; not a formal definition.
