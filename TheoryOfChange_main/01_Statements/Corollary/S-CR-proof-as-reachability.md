# Proof as reachability; disjunction as min-join (⊕)
## Statement (corollary)
In quantale logic, composition (⊗) encodes path proof; disjunction/aggregation is min‑join (⊕). Thus, proving is connecting with minimal effort, and alternatives aggregate by keeping the best.

## Philosophical Translation
To prove is to get there; “or” keeps the easiest way.
