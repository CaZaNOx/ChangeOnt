A performative contradiction is a action where the performing of the action structurally invalidates certain statements logically. Saying the statement "I can't speak" automatically makes it false in the literal sense because saying something means you can speak which therefore means the statement " I cant speak" is false. Or formulated differently If the statement "I cant speak" were true you couldn't have uttered it in the first place.
