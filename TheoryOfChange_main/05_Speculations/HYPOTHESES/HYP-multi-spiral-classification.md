# Multi-spiral relational axes for identity and function
## Claim
Spiral-space admits multiple relational axes (e.g., developmental history, functional convergence, intentionality, information architecture) that correspond to different evaluation structures. These “spiral trees” allow the same system to appear distant on one axis (history) while proximate on another (function or intent). The relative positioning explains why markets may be functionally close to consciousness while lacking self-recursive origin.

## Operational sketch
- Construct a multi-axis classification space where each axis tracks a type of recursive continuity (genetic lineage, functionality, teleological narrative, symbolic expression) using LocalReach neighborhoods plus memory-trace integration.
- Plot systems (e.g., humans, AIs, markets) according to their history depth vs. functional similarity, so we see adjacency/clustering relations that depend on the axis.
- Use this space to resolve edge cases (markets vs consciousness, species identity after dramatic change) by specifying which axis is relevant for the question at hand.

## Implication
The multi-spiral framework gives a principled way to differentiate between recursive systems that share structure but diverge in origin, enabling precise modeling of identity, evolution, and functional pattern equivalence without forcing a single universal category.
