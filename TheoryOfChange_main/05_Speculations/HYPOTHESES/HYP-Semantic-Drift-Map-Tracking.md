# Hypothesis — Semantic Drift Map Tracking (early warning)
Proposal
- Track evolving embedding neighborhoods and symbol alignments as a “drift map”; trigger early warnings when drift crosses declared thresholds before structure collapses.

Test sketch
- Metrics: neighborhood Jaccard/CS changes, gauge curvature shifts, SRL drops. Alerts: pre‑collapse bands tied to RTV/SE budgets.
