# Subject — that which has experience
## Claim (formal)
Subject := that for which experience obtains.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
“Subject” just means: something for which experience happens. The point is not to define a mysterious inner substance, but to mark the locus where experience obtains.

## Philosophical Justification
The ordinary term “subject” ceases to apply if no experience is possible. Thus experience is constitutive of subjectivity. This is not circular but co‑constitutive: the meanings of subject, awareness, and experience inter‑define one another at the ground level. Trying to reduce one to the others too early destroys the phenomenon we intend to describe.

## Explanation (informal)
Defines the minimal sense in which “you” are a subject: as bearer of experience.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-FT-immediate-datum]], experience is given; a “subject” is the locus of that givenness.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Definition schema: Subject(S) := ∃E: Experience(E) ∧ Bears(S, E)
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- proof: definitional; co‑defined with awareness and experience.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Distinguish “subject” from inanimate object via presence of experience.
