# Algebra of frame operators (Tx)
## Claim (formal)
Tx operators compose and admit identity elements relative to frames: (Tx, ∘, I) with domain of definition restricted by LocalReach and frame-compatibility. Composition respects reach: if Tx₁: (S, F)→(S₁, F₁) and Tx₂: (S₁, F₁)→(S₂, F₂), then Tx₂∘Tx₁: (S, F)→(S₂, F₂).

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Frame changes can be chained consistently; some do nothing (identity). Not all chains are allowed — only those whose endpoints can be reached.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Closure here is about the algebra of Tx on admissible frames, not about fixed‑space Markov closure.
- Inverses may fail or be partial; record collapse ⊘ where composition breaks.

## Derivation (Formal)
```text
Define Dom(Tx) ⊆ LocalReach×Frames. If (x,F)∈Dom(Tx₁) and Tx₁(x,F)=(x₁,F₁), and (x₁,F₁)∈Dom(Tx₂), define Tx₂∘Tx₁(x,F)=(x₂,F₂).
I(x,F)=(x,F).
```
