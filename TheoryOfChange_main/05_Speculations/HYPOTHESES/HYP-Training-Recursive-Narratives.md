# Hypothesis — Training via recursive narratives and goal‑fracture sets
Proposal
- Use conflict‑laden recursive narratives (Gödel sentences, paradox loops) and goal‑fracture simulation sets to foster non‑mimetic, self‑corrective recursion.

Test sketch
- Compare agents trained with/without recursive perturbation mandates; measure SRL, GH backlog, and drift arrest rates.
