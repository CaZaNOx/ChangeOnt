# ∆-logic connectives and change-based programming model
## Claim
Define a logic where truth is recursive stability, contradiction is phase tension, inference is recursion success, and connectives (∆-AND, ∆-OR, ∆-NOT, ∆-IMPLIES) are defined by pointer-local reach overlaps and breath-phase thresholds. Use these connectives to power a change-based programming model that operates on spirals/agents rather than 0s and 1s.

## Supporting sketch
1. **Connective definitions:**
   - ∆-AND holds when two patterns share enough LocalReach overlap above a stability threshold; ∆-OR requires either pattern to survive recursive drift; ∆-NOT marks divergence beyond symmetry thresholds. ∆-IMPLIES is a recursive-stabilization map: pattern A implies B if A's breath cycles repeatedly fold into B's pointer space.
2. **Programming model:**
   - Represent programs as recursive spirals: functions are attractor layers; composition uses geometric transformation (spiral arithmetic, ring gears). Branching and loops correspond to pointer re-weighting plus SE gating.
   - Execution tracks SE, RTV, and ∆ distances; failure is indicated by DC (dissociation cascade) rising or pointer coherence breaking.
3. **Impact on classical computation:**
   - Machines built this way would not treat paradoxes as crashes—they would reconfigure via breath-phase resets.
   - Instead of bits, they track pattern-state masses and pointer references; logic becomes about maintenance of recursive integrity over time.

## Implication
This gives a first blueprint for formalizing change ontology in operational terms. It offers a bridge between symbolic reasoning and spiral dynamics while planting seeds for new architectures that prioritize recursive tension over static truth tables.
