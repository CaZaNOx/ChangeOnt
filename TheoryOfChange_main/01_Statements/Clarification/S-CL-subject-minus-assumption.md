# Derive the subject from change, not assume it

The "subject" must appear as a derived quotient/residue from the immediate datum, not as a stated primitive. When the log says "a subject notices change" or names an observer before deriving it, rewrite those passages to show how minimal residues form the witnessing subject. This satisfies AI_18's insistence on building up the framework without smuggling ontological commitments.
