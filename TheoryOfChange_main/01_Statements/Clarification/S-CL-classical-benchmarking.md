# Benchmarking change ontology against classical models
## Content
To demonstrate added value, compare the ontology to classical models on the same datasets or processes. Log every event where the classical model cannot express a transition because the space, subject, or rules themselves had to shift—these become the Gödel-hole markers described earlier.

## Clarification
- The benchmark ledger should note: which operator ran, which field mutated, and why the classical model lacks a representation (e.g., it assumes static space or no boundary migration). The change ontology wins when its collapse markers fire at those points and lead to continued modeling.
- Non-classical factors are thus precisely the markers and operators that log these events; they are not mystical but operational (phase transition triggers, boundary migration counters, collapse ledger entries).

## Implication
This satisfies the Spiral5 request for empirical–structural predictions that classical models cannot encode and gives future practitioners a reproducible protocol for evaluating the change-first framework.
