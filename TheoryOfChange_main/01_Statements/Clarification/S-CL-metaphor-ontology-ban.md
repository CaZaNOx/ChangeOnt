# Keep spiral/circle metaphors as models, not ontological claims

Metaphors like spiral vs. circle should remain explanatory scaffolding rather than ontological commitments. Until you provide falsifiers distinguishing them, describe them as modeling choices ("as a spiral"/"as a circle"), not as statements about what the world "is." This prevents the metaphors from hiding smuggled classical structure and keeps testability intact.
