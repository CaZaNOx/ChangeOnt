# Hindsight equivalence triggers canonicalization

Whenever retrospective equivalence `Π_ε` identifies two paths with bend distance ≤ ε and cost difference ≤ δ, the system collapses them into a single canonical representative (EC) and merges their motifs (EI). The planner lowers branching budgets on the collapsed fork and records the equivalence error `e_eqv` for audits. This retroactive quotienting prevents redundant exploration and preserves logs of exploited symmetries.
