# Prior, Pointer, and Reach
Overview:
From Δ in the now, the subject can structurally infer an elsewhere (a not‑now) without presupposing memory or linear time. This inference appears as a pointer (⇘/↶) and induces a reach relation across change that is transitive and defines a local reach zone.

Canonical statements (to be linked):
 - [[S-DF-pointer-structural]] (DF)
 - [[S-DF-reach-relation]] (DF)
 - [[S-CR-delta-now-implies-pointer]] (CR)
 - [[S-DF-localreach-topology]] (DF)
 - [[S-DF-locality-prior]] (DF)
 - [[S-DF-depth-reach]] (DF)
  - [[S-DF-locality-threshold]] (DF)

Dependencies:
- From: [[02_Concepts/C-ontology-of-change]]
- To: [[02_Concepts/C-frame-operators]]

Open items:
- Formalize the local reach zone and its measurement under ε, σ(ε).
