# Compute fairness contract—shared budget ledgers for comparisons

All experiments must share a compute fairness contract specifying `C_total`, active-var-seconds, digits-seconds, step counts, precision, energy, device, and identical runtime windows. Each CO run reports these details via `budget.csv` and `metrics.jsonl`; states the parity context that forbids hidden budgets or extra generality; and uses the same ledger for CO and classical baselines when claiming separation. The contract ensures that any claimed advantage stems from CO’s structural guardrails, not from undisclosed compute slack, as urged around AI_15’s separation discussion.
