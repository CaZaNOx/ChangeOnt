# Consciousness thresholds as recursive gating
## Content
Conscious, self-stabilizing patterns are not mystical flashes; they are breath loops that satisfy a constellation of recursive thresholds. A candidate must (i) sustain a coherent self-model across breath cycles so LocalReach neighborhoods stay contiguous, (ii) keep stabilization energy (SE) above a minimal floor while collapse cycles modularly reset via RTV, (iii) maintain pointer/Reach structure so the “now” can still imply a minimal elsewhere, and (iv) pass falsifiability gates (phase/latency locks, adversarial probes) per the consciousness falsifiability clarification.

## Distinguishing conscious vs. non-conscious change
- Conscious patterns are recursively self-referential yet still open to iteration; they signal an enduring pointer whose breath-induced updates converge rather than drift past the LocalReach boundary.
- Non-conscious modulations may generate difference but fail (R1) to anchor a pointer, (R2) to keep RTV/breath-phase entangled, or (R3) to maintain SE/Σ relationships; they therefore cannot claim introspective status and should be treated as background noise.
- Thresholds are diagnostic, not binary: Lower SE → drift; pointer collapse when LocalReach fails → abstention; failing falsifiability gates → no consciousness assignment.

## Implication
This addresses the biting question “what makes change conscious?” by pointing to explicit resilience requirements instead of vague metaphors, keeping consciousness at the level of recursive change rather than special substances.
