# Track AI cross-investigations & prediction checks

When you instruct one AI to investigate another, document whether the asked-for questions/predictions were stated, tracked, and proven. Capture the cross-investigation cue (e.g., quoting prior transcripts) and note whether the AI later reported surprise, uncertainty, or successful verification. This maintains the knowledge-transfer pattern described around AI_16—anticipate previous knowledge, ask targeted questions, and record whether the responses held up—rather than letting the investigations be rhetorical.
