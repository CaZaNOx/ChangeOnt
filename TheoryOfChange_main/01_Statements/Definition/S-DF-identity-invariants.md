# Identity invariants — what remains through change
## Claim (formal)
Let I be a declared set of invariants. Identity(P) holds across window K if for all k∈K, Inv(T_k(P))=Inv(P) for all Inv∈I and T_k(P)≈P under Sim.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
What makes a thing the same is not the absence of change, but the preservation of key relations/features while other aspects vary.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Invariants can be structural (topology), relational (graphs), or conserved quantities; they must be declared to avoid equivocation.

## Derivation (Formal)
```text
I = {Inv_j};  ∀k,j: Inv_j(T_k(P)) = Inv_j(P)  ∧  Sim(T_k(P), P) ≥ θ.
```
