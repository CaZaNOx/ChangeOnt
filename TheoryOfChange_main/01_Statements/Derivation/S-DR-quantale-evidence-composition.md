# Evidence composition under quantale logic (min-plus / inf-convolution)
## Claim (formal)
Let (L, ≤, ⊕, ⊗) be a quantale with ⊕ = pointwise min (weighted join) and ⊗ = inf‑convolution (path composition). For evidences e₁, e₂: X→ℝ₊ representing costs/negatives of support, the composed evidence satisfies:

(e₁ ⊗ e₂)(z) = inf_{x+y=z} (e₁(x) + e₂(y))

and aggregation across alternatives is e₁ ⊕ e₂ = min(e₁, e₂). Then ⊗ distributes over arbitrary joins (mins), ensuring associative, monotone composition of partial evidences consistent with CO’s path semantics.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
When multiple partial reasons support a change, we combine their best‑fitting paths (compose) and keep the least costly explanations among options (join). This respects how change accrues along trajectories and how alternatives compete.

## Worked micro‑example
- Suppose two independent cues contribute additive effort: e₁ for reaching A, e₂ for reaching B. The cost to reach A then B is the best split of effort along the way: e₁⊗e₂.
- If there are two distinct ways to reach A (e₁, e₁′), their joint support is the better one: e₁⊕e₁′.
