# Classify Gödel holes by their adaptive roles

Gödel holes are not uniform: some boundaries pressure agents into new variables or rules (creative Gödel holes), others trap them forever (dead-end holes), and others act as porous filters whose structure permits only particular trajectories. Classify each logged hole by its local boundary shape, the meta-move density nearby, the availability of creative options, and the structural outcome it produces. This recursive classification lets you spot which regions of the metaspace drive innovation, which are extinction traps, and which can be tuned to filter structural diversity. Mapping those classes across timeseries, evolutions, or derivations gives you a measurable, auditable axis for comparing systems and for recommending where to focus further exploration, as the adjacent recursive-adaptation audit emphasizes.

Link this classifier to the existing ledger so every non-classical event entry includes a hole-type tag; the classification becomes a provenance-aware feature for meta-level prediction and system design.
