# Relating SRL to SE and θ
## Claim (formal)
Higher SE and appropriate θ (similarity threshold) increase SRL by stabilizing identity recognition across breath cycles; unstable SE or mis‑set θ reduce SRL.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Recurrence is easier to achieve when “what counts as the same” is robust and when the pattern resists drift.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- This links identity robustness (SE, θ) with validation dynamics (SRL), tying ontology to operational tests.
