# Hypothesis — Goal emergence from feedback (goal-less to telic)
Proposal
- Start with agents without explicit goals; allow feedback (reward/punishment proxies) to shape RTV budgets and SE. Test whether stable telic patterns (goals) emerge from recursive stabilization rather than being specified.

Test sketch
- Loop: noise → feedback → reweight attention → SE/≈ markers tracked → lock persistence. Observe whether consistent preference patterns (proto‑goals) form and persist under perturbations.
