# Responding to Gödel hole pressure is meta-competitive advantage

When a naive traversal predicts one system should dominate but another survives, look for a Gödel hole-driven innovation: the survivor encountered a dead-end or paradox and responded by inventing a new variable, rule, or meta-move. Audit every candidate instance by tracing (1) where the hole appeared, (2) whether the survivor created new structure at that moment, and (3) how that addition altered the subsequent landscape. Systems (species, agents, algorithms) that reliably sense the structural pressure of holes and spawn the minimal extension needed to escape become meta-competitive—they can keep rewriting their own change-space in response to every collapse and thus resist eventual extinction. This is measurable, auditable, and falsifiable: if no new structure emerges the prediction still needs refinement, but if the hole-response is present you have a precise explanation for the surprising outcome and a lever for future meta-prediction.

Encode this rule within your change ontology benchmarks so you log hole encounters, the candidate innovations they trigger, and whether those innovations shift the meta-level metrics you care about (robustness, return flow, reachability, etc.).
