# Gauge, HAQ, and Stabilization

Scope
- Alignment transport Γ, curvature K; HAQ warp α; breath‑mediated stabilization.

Core nodes
- DF: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-gauge-alignment-field]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-prm-gauge]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-elm-ea-haq]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-breath-field-global-integrator]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-stabilization-energy]]
- DR: [[01_Statements/Derivation/S-DR-breath-stabilization]]

Key takeaways
- Learn a connection Γ to minimize tension mismatch; curvature K as coherence signal.
- HAQ adapts warp α via EMA of holonomy defect; breath integrates validation.

Open items
- Practical calibration of HAQ/Γ in domain instances.
