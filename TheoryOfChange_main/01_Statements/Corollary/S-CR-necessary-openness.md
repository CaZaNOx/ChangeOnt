# Necessary openness — robust agents expose unknown/abstain gates
## Statement (corollary)
Given self‑containment limits, agents must provide explicit “unknown/abstain” modes and defer upward when needed; forced closure induces brittleness.

## Philosophical Translation
Honesty about not‑knowing is a feature, not a bug.
