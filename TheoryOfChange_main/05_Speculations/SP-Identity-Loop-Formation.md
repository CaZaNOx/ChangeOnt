# Identity Loop Formation — stabilization under Δ, SE, σ(ε)
Summary:
Heuristic criteria for identity loop stabilization; aligns with identity, SE, and σ(ε) nodes.

Why speculative:
Criteria are qualitative; thresholds situational.

Recommended next step:
Translate into measurable criteria in worked models; add CL to identity-through-change.
