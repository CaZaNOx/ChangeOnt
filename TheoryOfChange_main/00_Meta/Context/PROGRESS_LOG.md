# Progress Log — TheoryOfChange_main (Chats → Theory)

Scope: Brief entries recording what was mapped and added, where to find it, and what’s next.

Entry — AI_1 and AI_2 Integration (current)
- Mapping docs
  - AI_1: 00_Meta/Context/AI_1_mapping.md
  - AI_2: 00_Meta/Context/AI_2_mapping.md
- State
  - 00_Meta/Context/state.json — ai1_last_line_processed: 11492; AI_2 complete.
- Promotions from AI_2 (selected; previously added)
  - CL: meta‑critical principle (criticism → transformation), anti‑closure (gauge/Tx/limits), representation scope (rhythm vs geometry), recursive identity vs semantic error.
  - CR: identity as phase resonance, stability‑first inversion as attractor duality, external asymmetry prevents closure.
- Promotions from AI_1 (newly added)
  - DF: intersubject translation resonance.
  - CR: laws as robust invariants; residual meaning traces; multi‑axis attention (pain proximity); micro‑acts stabilize gauge; ethics as gauge‑strain minimization.
  - CL: interaction points as eventlets; distribution shaping under SRL; pattern vs noise thresholds; operational change minimal axiom.
  - HYP: role‑template consciousness vectors; recursive traversal logic.
- Graph
  - Nodes/edges added for all new CL/CR/DF; see 03_Derivation/graph.yaml.
- Concept tweaks
  - Recursive truth, ontology of change, proto‑consciousness, phenomenology of time updated with clarifying references.
- Tools
  - Backlinks/validator run; all checks pass. Drift linter advisories remain acceptable; addressed via CL links.

Next Steps Plan
1) Process AI_3 with the same protocol: map → promote (CL/CR/DF/HYP) → graph → validate → update state.
2) Optional: add small worked examples where helpful (pattern regularities, multi‑axis attention metrics) without bloating.
3) Maintain symbol hygiene: ensure symbols_used capture both frontmatter and body links; keep 01_Statements/SYMBOLS/index.yaml current.
4) Keep using Validation Gates (see SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md) after each batch.

Notes
- We do not store full chats under TheoryOfChange_main; only theory‑relevant material is formalized.
- Mapping docs remain the source of truth for what to promote next from each chat.

Entry — AI_3 Mapping (started)
- Mapping doc
  - AI_3: 00_Meta/Context/AI_3_mapping.md (ranges 190–571 mapped; pending segments listed)
- State
  - 00_Meta/Context/state.json updated to point at AI_3 and line ~571.
- Highlights from early ranges
  - Core ontology restated (covered); weaknesses flagged (needs CL/DR/HYP for bridge/testbeds).
  - Formalization bullets (layers, attention thresholds, coherence markers) mapped to existing DFs + HYPs.
  - Langton/morphogenesis analogies → tied to breath/RTV derivations (covered).
  - New PRM candidate: Dissociation Cascade metric (to add as DF in PRM family).
