# Δ(Now) implies Pointer(Now)
## Claim (formal)
Δ(Now) ⇒ Pointer(Now) := ∃p [p ≠ Now ∧ Reach(p, Now)].

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
If something is changing right now, the present points beyond itself — there must be an elsewhere relative to which it differs.

## Philosophical Justification
Change makes difference explicit. A difference without any elsewhere collapses into nonsense; “different from what?” The pointer captures the minimal elsewhere implied by Δ(Now), without invoking memory or clock time.

## Derivation (Formal)
```text
Δ(Now) ⇒ ∃p : p ≠ Now ∧ Reach(p, Now)
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Elsewhere need not be an object; it is a position in the reach structure.
