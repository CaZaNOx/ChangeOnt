# σ(ε) — Sensitivity fluctuation

Definition (formal):
Variation of sensitivity threshold; models resolution instability as ε changes.

## Math
```math
\sigma(\varepsilon) := \text{Var}(\text{sensitivity} | \varepsilon)
```

## Example
- Increased noise raises σ(ε), making detection less reliable.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Epsilon]] (ε)

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
The sensitivity threshold itself varies; sometimes we can tell small changes apart, sometimes not.

## Philosophical Justification
Resolution is not fixed: noise, load, and context affect what we can discriminate.

## Explanation (informal)
σ(ε) captures instability in detection, crucial for robust protocols and for explaining drift.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- High σ(ε) implies unreliable judgments near ε.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Model how σ(ε) affects collapse criteria and truth valuation.
