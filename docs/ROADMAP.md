# ROADMAP — Rungs & Next Steps

## Rung 1 (this repo)

- Freeze philosophy, math, logic, spec a–i, headers, guardrails, falsifiers.
- Implement renewal/codebook + drifting bandit + small maze.
- Produce JSONLs & plots; meet acceptance bands.

## Rung 2

- Add real-data tasks where CO is plausibly advantageous (market microstructure regimes; nonstationary recommendation; adaptive routing).
- Stronger baselines (well-tuned RNNs/Transformers) under budget parity.

## Rung 3

- Public prereg & replication pack; blind external reruns.
- Adversarial test suite; ablations; mis-spec stress.

**Ongoing:** Extend CO-math (quantale proofs), CO-logic sequent calculus, attractor-layer catalog.
