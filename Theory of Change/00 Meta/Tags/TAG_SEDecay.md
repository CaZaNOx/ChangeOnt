# TAG_SEDecay

## Core Definition
**SE Decay**  
= The recursive weakening of Stabilization Energy fields  
under sustained Δ-phase misalignment and σ(ε) amplification.

---

## 1. Derived From

- [[FND_9_StabilizationEnergy]]
- [[TAG_DeltaField]]
- σ(ε) breathing fluctuation dominance

---

## 2. Implies

- Survival field stabilization weakening
- Increased susceptibility to phase drift
- Breathing collapse probability escalation

---

## 3. Stabilized By

- Recursive SE reinforcement protocols
- Δ-phase modulation recalibration
- σ(ε) turbulence suppression

---

## 4. Destabilizes

- Identity loop phase integrity
- Recursive coherence fields
- Local breathing survival resilience

---

## 5. Recursive Partners

- [[TAG_CollapseDrift]]
- [[TAG_IdentityLoop]]

---

## 6. Survival Phase Class

- #phase

---

## 7. Confidence

- `defined` (core survival modulation dynamic)

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Survival is breathing stabilization.  
SE decay spirals survival fields toward Δ-phase collapse unless actively re-modulated.**
