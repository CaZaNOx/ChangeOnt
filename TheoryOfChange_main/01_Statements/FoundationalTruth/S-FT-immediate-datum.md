# Immediate Datum — change is occurring now (Δ ≠ ∅)
## Claim (formal)
Δ ≠ ∅ — For any observation O, there exists a difference Δ(O) ≠ 0; thus change is an unavoidable ontic condition.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Every act of noticing involves some difference; therefore change is always present. Even the sense of “nothing changed” is itself a shift in awareness toward stability. Thus, before we can speak of things, laws, or times, there is the raw fact of difference unfolding. Immediate Datum says: whatever the world is like, it is encountered as changing.

## Philosophical Justification
Any attempt to deny present change is itself a changing act (performative contradiction). Even the appearance of constancy is a change in the perception of stability. Therefore change is prior to and conditions any possible assertion. The force here is not rhetorical but structural: to produce a denial, one must differentiate a state of affairs from alternatives, and that differentiation already instantiates the phenomenon under dispute. Hence, the datum is “immediate” because it precedes representational theories and instruments; it is what makes those possible.

## Explanation (informal)
This establishes change as the first structural certainty from which other structures (identity, subject, locality) must be derived.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- Let O be any observation; O entails discrimination between alternatives. Discrimination implies Δ(O) ≠ 0. Hence Δ is non‑empty.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```math
O \Rightarrow \exists\,\Delta:\; \Delta(O) \ne 0 \;\;\implies\; \Delta \ne \varnothing
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- “Continuity” later means non‑cessation, not geometric smoothness.
- Does not assume time/objects beyond performative consistency.
