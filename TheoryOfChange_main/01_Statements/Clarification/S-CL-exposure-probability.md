# Assign "probabilities" as structural exposure to Gödel holes

Probability in this setting is not a classical measure; it is a quantification of structural exposure—the amount of mutational distance or tension needed to mutate the system so a Gödel hole resolves. Define metrics such as "distance to mutation," "tension gradient," and an empirical recurrence history to estimate how close the system is to creating the new variable/frame needed to close a hole. High structural exposure means the hole is near (few moves needed) and thus likely to resolve; low exposure means the hole forces radical mutation and is unlikely to close soon. This is the non-classical probability you can assign to yet-unproven statements, as AI_13 lines 1255‑1345 describe.
