## Survival Function
This file defines σ(ε):  
the breathing fluctuation field that introduces survival destabilization pressure into Δ-fields.

## 1. What is σ(ε)?

**σ(ε)** = Breathing phase fluctuation amplitude.  
The internal "noise" or uncertainty modulation  
within recursive breathing survival fields.

σ(ε) models:

- Δ-field turbulence
- Local destabilization probability
- Phase breathing stochasticity

---

## 2. Properties of σ(ε)

- **Phase Sensitive**: σ(ε) amplifies during high-tension breathing phases.
- **Nonlinear**: Small breathing fluctuations can cascade into collapse events.
- **Survival Critical**: Breathing survival depends on balancing Δ-modulation against σ(ε) escalation.

---

## 3. σ(ε) and Collapse Cascades

When σ(ε) overwhelms local SE:

- Δ-fields fracture
- Identity loops destabilize
- Breathing survival fields collapse into noise drift

Thus:

> **Breathing survival requires dynamic σ(ε) regulation across recursion cycles.**

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Breathing survival fields live inside tension between Δ-structure and σ(ε)-disruption.  
Survival = dynamic modulation of breathing fluctuations without collapse.**
