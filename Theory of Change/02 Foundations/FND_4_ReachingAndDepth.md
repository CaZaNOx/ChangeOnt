## Step 4: Reaching and Depth — Structuring the Continuity of Change

### Premise

If change is continuous and never stopped, then between any observed point and the Now, there must be a **structure of intermediate difference**. This gives rise to two emergent constructs: **reaching** and **depth**.

---

### 1. From Change to Reaching

We observe that change is **always present** (`Δ(Now)`), and — as shown in [[FND_2_PriorAndContinuity]] — **must have been present in all prior states**.

Let `p₁` be any abstracted reference point, labeled by the subject, such that `p₁ < Now` (earlier than Now in relative reach).  
Because change is continuous, we know there exists a point `p₂` such that:

- `p₂` is between `p₁` and `Now`
- `p₁` will eventually “reach” `p₂`
- `p₂` will then “reach” `Now`

We define:

> `Reach(p₁, p₂)` := *Point p₁ reaches p₂ if p₂ lies on the path of continuous change between p₁ and Now*

This introduces **a local directionality and traceable continuity**, without requiring any fixed metric or external scale.

---

### 2. Between and Nested Reachability

We now define a ternary relation:

> `C(p₃, p₂, p₁)` := *p₃ lies between p₁ and p₂*,  
> if and only if  
> `Reach(p₁, p₃)` and `Reach(p₃, p₂)`

This yields the following derived property:

- `Reach(p₁, p₂)` and `Reach(p₂, p₃)` ⇒ `Reach(p₁, p₃)`

Thus, **reachability is transitive** under continuity.

This constructs a **relational ordering** that allows us to speak of **nested reachability** and **change between changes**.

---

### 3. Clarifying Countability vs. Depth

A crucial clarification:

- The labels `p₁`, `p₂`, `p₃`, ... are **named markers** used by the subject to track change.
- But change itself is **not countable** in this way.
- Between any two points, we can always find another point of difference.  
  This expresses **continuity**, not discreteness.

We refer to this as **depth**:

> `Depth(p)` := *How close point p is to Now in terms of change traversal*

This is not a number. It is an **abstract gradient** of proximity — a **structural relation** grounded in the continuity of change, not an external clock.

---

### 4. Reformulation

Let `Δ` be change, `Now` the current moment of experience.

Then:

- `Δ(Now)`  
- ∀`p₁ < Now`, ∃`p₂` such that `C(p₂, p₁, Now)`  
- ∴ Reaching chain exists from any labeled point to Now  
- ∴ Depth is definable as structured proximity under change

---

### Commentary

- We are not assuming "time".  
  Reaching is **structural**, not temporal.  
  We know p₁ reaches p₂ *because* change has not stopped — not because a clock ticked.

- We are not introducing "distance" in any metric sense.  
  **Continuity** allows only relational in-betweenness, not quantitative gaps.

- This also lets us distinguish **observable change** from **sub-threshold change**:  
  Change may be occurring in ways that are not yet visible to the subject, but will be reached — or not — depending on how continuity unfolds.

#core/chain

## Step 4a: Forward Reach and the Structure of the Future

### Claim / Premise  
**If change is happening in the now, and continuity holds, then reachable futures are structurally implied — even if not yet experienced.**

---

### Justification

We have already established:
1. `Δ(Now)` – Change is happening in the now  
2. `⇘` – There is a pointer to not-now  
3. `Reach(p, Now)` – There exists a structural path from prior to now  
4. `C(p1, p2)` – Continuity ensures no unreachable gaps in unfolding

However, our previous reach only accounted for **paths toward the now**.  
But continuity is **bidirectional**: if change cannot begin (FND_1), and cannot stop (by same logic), then:

> The now must itself be reachable **from prior** and must also unfold into **future reachable configurations**.

Even if the subject cannot point forward, the structure of change **implies forward reach**.

---

### Structural Inference

Let:
- `Reach(Now, f)` mean: there exists a path of continuous unfolding from the Now to a future point `f`.

Then:
- `Δ(Now)`  
- ∧ `C(p, q)` for all adjacent points  
- ⇒ `∃f: Reach(Now, f)`

This future point need not be observed — it is **implied** by the fact that:
> Change, once happening, does not terminate unless some contradiction of continuity arises.

---

### Implications

1. **The field of change includes a forward unfolding cone**: a **set of reachable futures**  
2. **The subject cannot point to future** (pointer asymmetry), but can **infer its structural existence**  
3. The **local unfolding** is not closed at Now — **Now is a phase in a larger recursion**

---

### Change-Safe Reformulation

Let:
- `Δ(Now)` := change is occurring in the now  
- `C(p, q)` := continuity between adjacent unfolding  
- `Reach(Now, f)` := continuous unfolding from Now to f

Then:
- `Δ(Now)` ∧ `C(Now, f)` ⇒ `Reach(Now, f)`
- ∃f: `Reach(Now, f)`

---

### Summary

This file establishes that **future reach is structurally required** by:
- The existence of change in the now  
- The continuous nature of unfolding  
- And the impossibility of total change collapse at Now

The subject occupies a **recursive slice** of a larger structure — one that reaches both backward and forward, though only the past is directly pointed to.

#core/chain

## Step 4b: Δ-Threshold and the Subject's Resolution Limit

### Claim / Premise  
**If the subject experiences change in the now, but continuity implies infinite divisibility, then the subject must have a minimum resolution threshold — a Δ below which change becomes unresolvable.**

---

### Justification

From earlier steps:
1. `Δ(Now)` – The subject experiences change in the now  
2. `C(p1, p2)` – Change is continuous and infinitely divisible  
3. `Reach(p, Now)` – There is always a deeper point on the path

But:  
> If there were no limit to resolution, then no discrete difference could be registered — and the subject would collapse into indistinguishability.

To experience change is to:
- Register difference  
- Compress unfolding  
- Form structural tension across comparison

This requires a **minimum resolvable difference**: a **Δ-threshold**.

---

### Definition

Let:
- `Δ-threshold(s)` := the smallest difference a subject `s` can distinguish  
- For any `p1`, `p2`, if `|p1 - p2| < Δ(s)`, then `p1 ≈ p2` for subject `s`

Then:
- The subject's experience of change is bounded **below**: change exists below Δ, but is **invisible to the subject**  
- This forms a **local resolution limit** — and defines the *coherence zone* of experience

---

### Consequences

1. **Infinite change does not imply infinite experience**  
2. **Subjects only experience change across thresholds** — i.e., they experience **summarized transitions**, not all raw micro-changes  
3. The subject is structurally **bounded** and **situated**

---

### Change-Safe Reformulation

Let:
- `Δ(Now)` := change is experienced  
- `C(p1, p2)` := continuity implies infinite divisibility  
- `Δ(s)` := subject-specific resolution threshold

Then:
- ∀p1, p2: `|p1 - p2| < Δ(s)` ⇒ `Indistinct(p1, p2)` for `s`

> Experience is not of all change, but of change **above threshold**.

---

### Summary

This file introduces the **resolution boundary** of the subject.  
Though change is continuous and unfolding, **experience is quantized** — bounded by Δ.

The subject’s perception is not arbitrary: it is structured by its **pointer collapse bandwidth** — the minimum difference it can integrate into the Now.

This sets the **structural boundary of intelligibility**.

# FND_4RecursivePaths

## 1. From Individual Contrasts to Sequences

A single contrast (x → y) tells us that one pattern turned into another.  But reality is richer: **events chain together**.  We call each such sequence of contrasts a **recursive path**.

---

## 2. Philosophical Explanation

1. **Narrative of Becoming**  
   - Just as words string together to form a sentence, contrasts string together to form a story of change.  
   - Each contrast builds on the last, showing how one pattern unfolds into the next over time.

2. **Why “Recursive”?**  
   - “Recursive” emphasizes that the same rule (detecting contrast) applies at every step, no matter how many links we chain.

---

## 3. Formal Definition

- **Recursive Path (⇝):**  
  A sequence of patterns $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n$ in the continuous flux such that for each $i$:
$$
    x_i \;\to\; x_{i+1}.
$$
  We write:
$$
    x_0 \;\overset{n}{\longrightarrow}\; x_n
    \quad\text{or}\quad
    x_0 \;\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!{\longrightarrow}{\!\!\!\!\!}^{*}\; x_n,
$$
  meaning $n$-step or any-step reachability.  

- **Concise Notation:**  
$$
    x \;\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!{\longrightarrow}{\!\!\!\!\!}^{*}\; y
    \quad\text{denotes “there exists some }n\text{ with }x_0 = x,\ x_n = y.”
$$

---

## 4. Key Properties

1. **Transitivity:**  
   If $x \overset{*}{\to} y$ and $y \overset{*}{\to} z$, then $x \overset{*}{\to} z$.

2. **Non-symmetry:**  
   $x \overset{*}{\to} y$ does not imply $y \overset{*}{\to} x$.

3. **Path Length:**  
   The number of contrasts $n$ gives a notion of **distance** in terms of change events (not spatial distance).

---

## 5. Implications

- **Extended Structures:**  
  Recursive paths let us model dynamic processes, causal chains, and evolving identities as built from fundamental contrasts.

- **Semantics of Identity:**  
  When a pattern loops back to itself over a recursive path ($x \overset{*}{\to} x$) under certain stability conditions, we call that a **recurring structure** or **self-stabilizing identity**.
