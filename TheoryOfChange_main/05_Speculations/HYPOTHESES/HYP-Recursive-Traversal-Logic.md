# HYP — Recursive Traversal Logic (RTL) as operational primitive

Claim (hypothesis)
- Define a logic from change-first traversal: truth = recurrence stability over traversals; composition = path concatenation; implication = residuation under traversal; supports multiway branching akin to quantales.

Sketch
- Map to [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-quantale-logic]]; test correspondence with [[01_Statements/Derivation/S-DR-quantale-evidence-composition]] and [[01_Statements/Derivation/S-DR-quantale-residuation-implication]].
