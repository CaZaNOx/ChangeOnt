# Memory trace and integration — reactivatable tension over experiences
## Claim (formal)
A memory trace is a stored structural tension (difference) that can be reactivated across multiple experiences to integrate evidence over time; maintained via attention scheduling and depth‑aware temporal ops.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
You can hold a difference so that it can matter later — bringing it back to guide how new moments fit with what you’ve learned.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Interacts with LocalReach depth (older traces discounted by depth and EMA).
- Supports self‑model updates, SE estimation, and expectation formation.
