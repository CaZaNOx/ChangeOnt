# Attractor field / spiral dynamics
## Claim (formal)
Breath dynamics on identity spaces induce spiral approaches to attractors; SE shapes basin structure; HAQ yields families of discrete attractors.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Patterns don’t just land; they orbit and settle in characteristic ways as the system breathes.
