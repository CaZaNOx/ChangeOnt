# Core Ontology Coverage — COT → Statements/Concepts/Graph

This crosswalk maps 01_CoreOntology content to canonical statements in TheoryOfChange_main and (where relevant) to graph node ids.

- COT_0_Introduction_and_Motivation
  - Motivation, critique of static ontologies → Context only (no unique DF); covered by FT root and Immediate Datum corollaries.
  - Links: [[01_Statements/FoundationalTruth/S-FT-root-minimal-stance]], [[01_Statements/FoundationalTruth/S-FT-immediate-datum]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-change-ontically-prior]]

- COT_1_Immediate_Observation_of_Change
  - Immediate Datum → [[01_Statements/FoundationalTruth/S-FT-immediate-datum]] (stmt.immediate-datum)
  - Performative contradiction → [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-performative-contradiction]]
  - Triad (subject/awareness/experience) → [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-subject]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-awareness]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-experience]]
  - Corollaries → [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-no-null-world]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-observation-subordinate]]

- COT_2_Formal_Derivation_of_Primacy_of_Change
  - Primacy of change → [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-change-ontically-prior]]

- COT_3_Meta_Change_Change_acting_on_Change
  - Meta‑change themes integrated via Tx and pointer/reach; formal DF: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-tx-operator]] and related DRs.
  - No additional unique DF required; narrative aligns with existing operators.

- COT_4_Structured_Pattern_Emergence; COT_5_Self_Similarity_and_the_Emergence_of_Identity
  - Identity through change → [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-identity-through-change]]
  - Thresholds → [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-self-similarity-threshold]]
  - SE, entropy → [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-stabilization-energy]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-entropy-co]]

Notes
- Introductory and narrative sections are context; all theory‑bearing claims are represented as statements with provenance.
