# Hypothesis — Paradox tolerance as recursive holding operator
Proposal
- Define a holding operator that sustains modeling of contradictory structures across breath cycles without collapse until sufficient evidence resolves ambiguity.

Test sketch
- Present controlled contradictions; measure lock stability vs premature collapse; classify resolution trajectories.
