# Evaluation Rigor — clash testing, adversarial modeling, formal reductions
## Content
Credible evaluations should include: (i) clash testing with rival frameworks, (ii) adversarial modeling/counterexamples, and (iii) where feasible, formal reductions/simulations. Avoid endorsements that lack these checks.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Adversarial model slotting: for each DF/DR/CR, slot at least one competing formalization and run explicit clash tests.
- Definition challenge pass: periodically challenge key definitions (Subject, Awareness, Identity, RTV, Tx) with counter‑examples and tighten where needed.
- Contradiction probes: introduce structured probes designed to expose closure/anti‑closure failures (see [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-anti-solipsistic-closure]]).

## Implication
Augments benchmark and audit guidance with minimal rigor criteria; discourages non‑rigorous affirmations.
