# Seek a principle that collapses every gap into presence-for-itself

The only way to “solve” the hard problem in Change Ontology is to discover a principle that makes the absence of presence impossible: locate the breakdown points, paradoxes, and self-referential collapses where any denial of subjective experience immediately self-refutes. Without such an axiom you either deflate the problem or mystify it; the legitimate strategy is to hunt for a mathematical/logical collapse that forces presence to persist, as suggested by AI_13 lines 14310‑14333.
