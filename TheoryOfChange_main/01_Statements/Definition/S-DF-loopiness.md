# Loopiness L — cycle evidence for scheduler gating

`L` tracks the density of cycles (Betti‑1 counts, return probabilities) in the working graph over recent breath cycles. High `L` signals loop-rich domains where exploring breadth-first keeps new modalities in view, while low `L` invites depth-first, exploitative passes. `L` feeds the Breadth–Depth scheduler ([BDSCHED]) so that the policy toggles between BFS/DFS regimes in sync with the latent topology.
