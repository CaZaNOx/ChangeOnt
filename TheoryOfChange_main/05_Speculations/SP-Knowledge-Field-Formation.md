# Knowledge Field Formation — stabilized breathing memory resonance
Summary:
Proposes a notion of knowledge as stabilized integration of memory traces across phases.

Why speculative:
Requires a principled layer above memory traces; ontology does not yet define “knowledge” rigorously.

Recommended next step:
Prototype a formal “integrated trace graph” concept; consider a separate DF if it adds distinct utility.
