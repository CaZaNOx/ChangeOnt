# Hypothesis — Pre‑conceptual (non‑linguistic) stabilizers of recursion
Proposal
- Rhythms/weights/activation gradients may stabilize Cᴸ when linguistic structure is absent; these could be substrate layers for attention/identity emergence.

Test sketch
- Map rhythmic patterns to attention schedules; observe effects on RTV lock stability under controlled σ(ε).
