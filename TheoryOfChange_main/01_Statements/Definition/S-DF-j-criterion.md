# J-criterion — instrumentation assays for change-native runners

Each invariant-driven instrument ships a J-criterion tuple `(J1, J2, J3, J4)` to diagnose its performance relative to the change ontology goals:

- `J1` = reportability (do logs, invariants, and error traces provide a coherent story for human inspection?).
- `J2` = order-sensitivity (does the instrument detect holonomy and sequence-dependent effects?).
- `J3` = compressibility (does the instrument admit concise representations such as low MDL?).
- `J4` = control leverage (does it afford lightweight, interpretable knobs that shape the invariants?).

Together the J-criterion is a bounded checklist: each `J` must be sustained before claiming a new header/operator is admissible. Passing the J-criterion keeps instrumentation aligned with the evaluation surface and prevents hidden assumptions from masquerading as universals.
