# Relating CBF to SRL, SE, and θ
## Claim (formal)
Increasing SRL and stabilizing identity (SE↑, θ tuned) increases CBF, holding GH backlog and Tx penalties constant.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
What regularly returns and robustly maintains its recognizable form counts as fitter under change.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Tx penalties discourage gratuitous frame shifts; GH backlog reduces fitness until resolved.
