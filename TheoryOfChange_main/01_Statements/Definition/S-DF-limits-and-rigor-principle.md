# Limits and Rigor — declare non-closure and stop
## Claim (formal)
When GH persists after declared attempts, or when Tx cannot be justified, declare non‑closure for the scope and stop. Document limits and conditions for re‑opening.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Rigor means not pretending to have closed what we cannot; we own the limits explicitly.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Protects against simulation drift and cargo‑cult closure.
