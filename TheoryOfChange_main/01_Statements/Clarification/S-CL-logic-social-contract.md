# Logic as an emergent social contract for contradiction handling
## Content
Logic isn’t absolute; it arises where agents agree on how to handle contradictions. Classical logic won the popularity contest not because it’s metaphysically true but because its aggressive contradiction handling made systems stable.

## Clarification
- Different communities can define alternative contradiction responses, producing distinct logics; the change-first program can host a family of truth-handling protocols.
- The “contract” is enforced by trace markers and collapse ledgers: if agents deviate, the contract breaks and collapse is triggered.

## Implication
This view keeps the theory from claiming universal logic while still building structured systems of contradiction resolution via the collapse ledger (AI_9) and the trace markers required in Spiral4.
