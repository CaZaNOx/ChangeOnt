# Hypothesis — Minimal noise+memory feedback loop agent
Proposal
- Implement a minimal agent with noise input, memory trace integration, and RTV‑guided attention; test emergence of stable patterns and locks without predefined goals.

Measures
- Lock persistence, SE trends, identity markers, drift maps; collapse regimes.
