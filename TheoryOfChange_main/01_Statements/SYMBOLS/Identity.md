# ≡ — Identity / equivalence

Definition (formal):
Identity or equivalence relation under specified criteria.

## Example
- a ≡ b under equivalence relation ~.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/NotEqual]] (≠)

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
Identity tells when changing things still count as the same — under stated criteria.

## Philosophical Justification
Change ontology needs identity to track persistence; ≡ sets the rules under which persistence holds.

## Explanation (informal)
≡ is a context-dependent identity; specify the equivalence relation and its invariants.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- ≡ without criteria invites confusion; pair with ≈ and Δ carefully.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Define identity-through-change invariants and tests.
