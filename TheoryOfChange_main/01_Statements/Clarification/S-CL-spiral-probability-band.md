# Visualize the spiral as a probability ribbon with interior holes and branching

The change spiral is best rendered as a thick, Möbius-like ribbon whose width encodes phase-specific probability space. Each phase (A1‑A4) wears its own color and hole-density; holes inhabit the band interior to show where Gödel paradoxes cluster, not merely along the edge. Branching appears as ribbon forks at phase transitions, and the whole structure tilts (2.5D) to reveal the self-similar, recursive layering of meta-phases. This visualization makes explicit what the ontology already claims: options, holes, and feedback vary per phase, and each layer's spiral recycles into the next with new density and speed.
