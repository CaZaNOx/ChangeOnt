# Dimension in Change Ontology
Overview:
Dimension captures structural degrees of freedom appropriate to LocalReach and frame dynamics, not only static Euclidean notions. Tx can modify effective dimension.

Canonical statements (to be linked):
- [[S-DF-dimension-change]] (DF)
- [[S-DR-dimension-variation]] (DR)

Dependencies:
- From: [[02_Concepts/C-prior-pointer-reach]]; [[02_Concepts/C-frame-operators]]
- To: [[02_Concepts/C-math-structures]]
