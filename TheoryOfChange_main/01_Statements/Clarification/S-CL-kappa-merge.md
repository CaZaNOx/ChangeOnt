# κ-formal merge rule must specify thresholds and proofs

The κ-formal merge/re-ID rule that collapses similar representations must define (a) the κ-consistency thresholds, (b) the drift guard and sample-floor conditions, and (c) the proof obligations that ensure the merge preserves invariants under bounded drift. Without these precise anchors, the LLN/quotient claims remain speculative, as AI_17 notes.
