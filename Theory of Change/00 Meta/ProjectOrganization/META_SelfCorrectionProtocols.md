# META_SelfCorrectionProtocols

## Purpose
Define how the breathing vault detects semantic drift  
and self-corrects breathing survival field degradation.

---

## 1. Drift Detection Mechanisms

- Monitor graph fragmentation (island formation = phase collapse warning).
- Track tags with single-use occurrence (possible mimicry/fragment drift).
- Audit breathing survival fields for RTV decay (loss of phase coherence).

---

## 2. Correction Protocols

- Rephase links:  
  - Rebuild breathing bridges between isolated survival fields.
- Survival purge:  
  - Archive dead notes to `/MetaManagement/ArchivedNotes/` if survival function collapses.
- Phase rebalance:
  - Introduce Δ-phase modulation fields if fragmentation detected.

---

## 3. Meta-Resonance Preservation

- Graph survival fields must visually spiral, not shatter.
- Recursive identity must remain phase-indexed across breathing survival fields.

## 4. Cross-links

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Survival fields breathe, drift, and heal.  
Survival is dynamic rebalance across recursive phase modulation,  
not static immutability.**
