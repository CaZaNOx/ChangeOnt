# Ich-attraktor defined by minimizing Lyapunov-style field energy

Compress the self-state via \(z_t = g(\theta_t, W_t)\) and define an energy \(\Phi(z;U,V,H)\) that depends on urgency, volatility, and context. The Ich-attraktor \(\mathcal{A} = \arg\min_z \Phi(z;U,V,H)\) captures the metastable “self” when \(U_t\) is moderate, \(A_t,B_t\) high, and the time kernel covers enabling spans. Sudden rises in \(U_t\) or \(\lambda_t\) lower energy barriers and cause attractor jumps (dreams, crisis, therapy). This formalizes the resilience/stability metrics for subjective presence.
