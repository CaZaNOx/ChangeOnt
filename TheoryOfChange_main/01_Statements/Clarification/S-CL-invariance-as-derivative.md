# Treat invariance as derivative of change, not its primitive

The CO core treats invariance as emerging from quotients over observable change rather than as a primitive assumption. When classical invariants appear, they are introduced via equivalence classes built from detectable deltas (`Δ`), reach relations, and quotient/closure operators; they never predate the performative route `DF 0.1`. This keeps the ontology change-first and prevents classical “substance” talk from sneaking back through invariance claims.
