# Identity — similarity, thresholds, SE, entropy

Scope
- Persistence as metastable self‑similarity; robustness and variety.

Core nodes
- DF: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-identity-through-change]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-similarity-operator]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-self-similarity-threshold]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-stabilization-energy]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-entropy-co]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-identity-invariants]]
- DR: [[01_Statements/Derivation/S-DR-entropy-vs-se]], [[01_Statements/Derivation/S-DR-srl-vs-se-theta]]

Key takeaways
- Identity is “close enough over transformations” with declared criteria.
- SE measures loop robustness; entropy measures pathway variety.

Open items
- Empirical calibration guidance for θ, ε, σ(ε) per domain.
