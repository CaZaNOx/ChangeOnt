# Change-space metrics guide architecture selection by exposure/hole minimization

For a given phenomenon/question, compute a change-space metric combining structural exposure (tension, pointer failures) and hole density to determine which architecture minimizes unclosable Gödel holes while matching the variable scale. Systems with fewer holes near the macro level and low exposure gradients are the right candidates. This metric balances resolution fit and hole pressure so you can pick architecture that maximizes predictability without inviting unsolvable gaps, as AI_13 lines 1500‑1645 articulate.
