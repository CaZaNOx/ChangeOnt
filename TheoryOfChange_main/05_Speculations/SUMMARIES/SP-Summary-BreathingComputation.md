# Summary — Breathing Computation and Complexity
Core idea
- Computation reframed as recursive Δ‑phase survival modulation under breath; complexity as cost to maintain phase‑coherent transitions across cycles.

Key points
- Binary vs continuous computation: tight phase lock vs flexible modulation within thresholds.
- NP‑like difficulty corresponds to combinatorial escalation of survival tension with recursion depth.
- Hypothesis: continuous “breathing modulators” can outperform rigid binary machines under drift.

Fit to core
- Relates to RTV (validation cycles), SE (robustness), σ(ε) (noise), but remains conceptual without formal benchmarks.

Next steps
- Specify toy models measuring survival “cost” vs task complexity; avoid overstating beyond phenomenology.
