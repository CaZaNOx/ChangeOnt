# Locality and Prior — constraints within LocalReach
## Claim (formal)
Locality constrains admissible Reach paths to LocalReach neighborhoods; “prior” denotes reachable positions relative to Now under locality, tracked via field and local pointers.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Not everything is equally “elsewhere.” What counts as prior is shaped by how change can actually move here and now.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Field vs local pointers let us distinguish global vs subject‑centric locality.
