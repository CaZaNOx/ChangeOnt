# Subject — Awareness — Experience (Minimal Triad)
Overview:
Mutually constitutive triad: a subject as bearer of experience; awareness as relation between subject and content.

Canonical statements:
- [[S-DF-subject]] (DF)
- [[S-DF-awareness]] (DF)
- [[S-DF-experience]] (DF)
 - [[S-DF-subject-recursive-field]] (DF)
 - [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-consciousness-loop]] (DF)

Dependencies:
- From: [[02_Concepts/C-ontology-of-change]]
- To: [[02_Concepts/C-prior-pointer-reach]] (planned)

Open items:
- Formalize measurement predicates for AwareOf(S, X) and content structuring (X).
