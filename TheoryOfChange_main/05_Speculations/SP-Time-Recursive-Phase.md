# Time as Recursive Phase Index — emergent rhythm, not absolute flow
Summary:
Reframes time as indexing of Δ‑phase modulations under breath and RTV/SE dynamics.

Why speculative:
Requires careful alignment to physics/time constructs; current theory does not define physical time.

Recommended next step:
Limit to phenomenological corollary under breath/RTV; avoid claims about external physical time without a bridge.
