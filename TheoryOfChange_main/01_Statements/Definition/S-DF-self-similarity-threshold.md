# Thresholds of identity formation — self-similarity criteria
## Claim (formal)
Identity recognition requires that self‑similarity across transformations exceed a critical threshold θ under declared criteria and tolerances (ε, σ(ε)).

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Identity is not all‑or‑nothing; it emerges once similarity is sufficiently strong to outpace background variation.

## Philosophical Justification
Recognition is always under resolution constraints. Thresholds make explicit when persistence counts as “the same” for theory and practice. Without thresholds, identity collapses into either dogmatic sameness or endless skepticism.

## Derivation (Formal)
```text
Let Sim(T_k(P), P) ∈ [0,1]. Identity(P) holds on window K if \frac{1}{|K|}\sum_{k∈K} Sim(T_k(P), P) ≥ θ.
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- θ, Sim, ε, σ(ε) must be specified per context; they govern ≈.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Relate θ to Stabilization Energy and entropy to assess robustness.
