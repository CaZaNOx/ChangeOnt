# Minimal structural threshold arises from pointers, not external stimuli

The smallest detectable difference (`Δ_min`) is not a fixed psychometric threshold but the smallest delta for which the agent's internal pointer/arisal system generates a new structural event. Track `Δ_min` as the infimum of deltas where `diff(x,y)` triggers a pointer (⇘) under the ontology's own metric, log it per-trial/context, and treat shifts in `Δ_min` as non-classical events (e.g., frame shifts or collapse-induced readiness). Experimental templates involve presenting nearly identical events, recording when the pointer fires, and logging the ledger entry, as AI_13 outlines.
