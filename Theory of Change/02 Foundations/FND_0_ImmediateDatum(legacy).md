## Chapter 0: Immediate Datum — Difference as the First Fact

### SECTION 0.1 — This Is Happening

**FT 0.1**  
You, the reader, are reading this.

**CF 0.1** (from FT 0.1)  
If you are not something, you can't be reading this — therefore the further statements are not addressed to you.

**DF 0.1** — *Performative Contradiction* := A contradiction in which the act of stating the proposition invalidates the proposition itself.  
(E.g. “I can’t speak” is invalidated by the act of speaking.)

**CF 0.2** (from FT 0.1 and DF 0.1)  
Stating “I’m not reading this” while reading it is a performative contradiction.

**FT 0.2**  
You are reading this sentence now.  
This is not a theory or assumption — it is a **fact of occurrence**.

**CF 0.3** (from FT 0.2, CF 0.1, CF 0.2)  
Negating FT 0.2 leads to a performative contradiction of a subject reading a sentence but denying this fact.

**FT 0.3**  
Reading is a process that creates a difference.

**CF 0.4** (from FT 0.3)  
If reading this led to no difference, that would imply:  
1) Before and after reading are indistinguishable, including time;  
2) No felt experience occurred while reading.  
This would reduce reading to an empty signifier.  
Objecting or agreeing would contradict FT 0.3.

**CR 0.2** (from FT 0.2)  
There is at least one Subject reading this.

**CR 0.3** (from CR 0.2)  
A subject exists (CR 0.2).  
We will now use this subject as our reference point going forward.  
No new assumptions are added.  
It’s simply the subject currently reading this —  
the one present in this moment.

**DF 0.2** — *Doubting* := Not agreeing completely with some statement.

**FT 0.4**  
Subjects can doubt.

**CF 0.5** (from DF 0.2 and FT 0.4)  
Doubting FT 0.4 means a Subject doubts that subjects can doubt.  
This is a performative contradiction.

**CR 0.4**  (from CF 0.5)
There are statements that cannot be doubted.

**DF 0.3**  
Doubting Subject :=  
A modeled subject that applies maximal doubt  
to all beliefs, perceptions, and assumptions —  
including those concerning its own presence.  
It is introduced as a tool to test which truths  
would remain undeniable  
even if everything else were rejected.  
Its only requirement:  
to have experience,  
and to not stop doubting.

**FT 0.5**  
Doubting one’s own existence still requires something that doubts.

**CF 0.6** (from FT 0.5 and DF 0.3)  
If the DS doubts its own existence, then there must be something that doubts.  
If this were not true, then nothing would be doubting — contradiction.

**CR 0.5**  
A DS can’t ultimately doubt:
- its own existence (from FT 0.5)  
- doubting itself (from CF 0.5)

**DF 0.4** — *Experience* := What a subject feels when noticing something.  
"Feel" doesn’t refer to sensory input  — it means the subject registers something internally.

**CR 0.6** (from DF 0.4)  
An experience requires a subject. No experience occurs without something that experiences it.

**FT 0.6**  
Subjects have experiences.

**CF 0.7** (from FT 0.6)  
If a subject had no internal experience, the term “subject” as something that has inner realizations would be meaningless.

**CR 0.7**  (from CF 0.7)
A subject without experience, or experience without a subject, does not exist.

**CR 0.8** (from FT 0.4 and DF 0.4)  
There is an experience of doubting. Doubting feels a certain way.

**CR 0.9** (from FT 0.6 and CR 0.5)  
A DS must grant that, even under maximal doubt,  
a subject exists and an experience is occurring.

**CR 0.10** (from CR 0.9)  
A DS can’t doubt the structural presence of a subject having experience — even with maximal doubt.

**DF 0.5** — *Content of Experience (CoE)* := Whatever is felt by the subject (from DF 0.4)

**DF 0.6** — *Structure of Experience (SoE)* := The fact that there is a subject experiencing — agnostic of content

CR 0.11 (from FT 0.4 DF 0.3 and DF 0.5) A DS can doubt CoE

CR 0.12 from CR 0.11 The possibility of  a subject Doubting any CoE means the subject can't say what it expieriences.
F.e. a subject could doubt that it is feeling pain but also doubt that it doesn't feel pain.
F.e2. A subject could doubt that two objects it percieves as CoE are seperate or that a object it percieves is a single thing. 

Cr 0.13 from CR 0.12 CoE allows no further derivation because the DS can't state anything about CoE without doubt.

CR 0.14 From CR 0.5
The DS can't doubt the presence of a minimal SoE that holds.

CR 0.15 from CR 0.14 A subject doubting all SoE leads to  a performative contradiction.

CR 0.16 from CR 0.15
Even if DS is unaware of CR 0.15 it still is true as a matter of fact that there is a SoE.

CR 0.17 from CR 0.13 If the SoE is a content of expierience it can be doubted in principal.

CR 0.18 cr 0.17 and CR 0.5  and CR 0.8 even treating SoE as content implies a SoE to be the case structurally.



CR 0.19 form CR 0.13 A DS can't reason about anything it expieriences or has any insight what it expierienced content wise only that it expierienced something.

DF 0.8 Relaxed DS (RDS):= A DS with maximal doubt regarding CoS with the ability to comprehend questions about SoE and being able to have minimal reasoning capabilities to answer or to follow basic insights.
Note: This needs to be added so we as outside observers could ask basic questions about what eypieriencing sth was like while still applying maximum doubt and not relaxing CoE requirements.
One way to imagine this is us asking a very small child that f.e. touched a hot stove about expieriencing (Structurally) and not about the content (e.g. what does it feel like) because we still assume it has no access to the content.

Cr 0.20 from DF 0.8
We can ask a RDS was the expierience always present or did it suddenly occur/happen?
Answer RDS: No/shaking of head (this expierience wasn't always the case) it happend.

**DF 0.7** — *Now* := The current experience of the subject.

CR 0.21 from CR0.20 and DF 0.7 Expieriences arise they aren't always the case. We call the moment they are taking place Now.

Derrived FT (DFT) 0.7 from CR0.21 Expierience occurs now

CF 0.8 (to DFT 0.7) If expierience would be taking place forever without difference then the subject couldn't realize they are happening. There would be no realization of having the expierience because it's exactly the same as before. In a sense the DS wouldnt be able to point out expieriences as anything more then a constant facts of life. 

CF 0.9 DF 0.4 implies that the subject has to notice sth. if it notices that the expierience is the same as it was prior it would either not be able to notive it (if everything stays the same) or if it would be able to notice that it is the same again it would have the new expierience of expieriencing the sameness as being the same.

Cr 0.22 from DFT 0.7 
If there is a now and this now wasn't always the case it implies that there is a different (not now) who's CoE remains unintelligble (The DS has no ability to state anything about what not now is)

CR 0.23 from CR 0.22 If there is an implied not now this means a RDS could answer the question if there is a not now (implied by answering was this always the case - no)

CR 0.24 The SoE implies a pointer to a not now that the DS has and that allows it to identify this expierience and this expierience.

CR 0.25 from CR 0.24 implies that there is difference between now and not now

DF 0.8 Change := Something is happening 

DFT 0.8 from CR 0.25 Change took place from not now to now giving rise to the expierience the subject has.

CF 0.10 to DFT 0.8 If change wouldn't habe taken place then the subject wouldn't have its current experience in the now.

CR 0.26 From DFT 0.8 Change led to the now happening 

DF 0.9 Prior := What was the case before the now.

CR 0.26 from DF0.9 and DFT 0.8  If the Prior didnt change to now the subject wouldn't have this expierience.

CR 0.27 from DF 0.9 and DFT 0.8 if prior and now would be the same then then the subject wouldnt have expierience.

DFT 0.9  From CR 0.26 Change is mandatory for expierience

CR 0.28 from DFT 0.9 and DF 0.4 
If Change is mandatory for expierience and difference is how we recognize change and expierience is the subject noticing something then there is change in the now

DFT 0.10 from Cr 0.28 change is happening now

DF 0.8 
 C(now) := Change is happening now.

CF 0.11 to DFT 0.10 if change wouldnt be happening now then the subject couldnt expierience anything

DFT 0.11 from DFT 0.10 If change is happening now then it has to have been present in the prior

CF 0.12 to DFT 0.11 if the prior didn't have change then it could have never led to the now. Because if there is no change in the prior it never would have changed to now.

Assumption AS 0.1 Let's assume that change isnt present in the prior.

From DFT 0.10 change is happening now.

CR0.29 from AS 1 and DFT 0.10 if AS 0.1 is true then DFT 0.10 couldn't have taken place. Or Prior had to change from not having change to having change.

CR 0.30 from Cr 0.29 if Prior changed from having no change to having change there has to be something that changed the prior 

CR 0.31 from cr 0.30 and AS 0.1 and DFT 0.10
Contradiction assumption of no change in prior implies no change can occur anymore but change id present in the now. Therefore change was present in prior.

CR 0.32 from CR 0.31 if change is present in the prior this implies either that 
1) Like for now happening and having change does require a prior with change so does the prior with change require a further prior
2) The prior has no further prior

CR 0.33 from CR 0.32(2)
If the prior had no further prior it had to arise from no change. If it arose from nothing then nothing changed to something and therefore nothing would have had change itself

CR 0.34 from Cr 0.32(2)
if the prior was always present and had change then the prior had to change from not changing to the now into changing into the now.
This implies that there are different "states" in the prior where one state in the prior is a prior to a different state in the prior meaning there are different states where one is a prior of the other.

CR 0.35 from CR 0.34 the prior that was always present is a grouping of multiple priors.Where the prior that changed to now requires fuether priors 

DFT 0.11 from Cr 0.32, Cr0.33 and CR 0.34
There are multiple priors

DFT 0.12 from DFT 0.11 Priors are mandatory requirements for the now 

CR 0.35 from DFT 0.12 
Priors of Priors are also mandatory conditions for the current expierience

AS 0.2 There is a minimal prior.
If there is a minimal (discrete) prior this means there cant be any smaller states in the prior.

CR.0.36 from DFT 0.11 and AS 0.2
If change is present in the prior it means that the prior had to change from being the prior to becoming/transitioning to the now.

Cr 0.37 from CR 0.36 and AS 0.2 if the prior can be divided up into smaller sections that where not all the same (implied by there being change) then AS2 was false (contradiction) change in prior implies continuity

CF 0.13 If there was no change in prior then it could have never change into now. If there is change in prior then there has to be a difference in the prior.
If cha ge only led to the prior but wouldnt be in the prior then the prior would have happend but it would not lead to further change.

DFT 0.12 from CR 0.35 There exists an infinite chain of priors mandatory for change to occure in the now/current expierience.

CR 0.38 from DFT 0.10 Change happening now means DFT 0.12 holds

DFT 0.13 from CR 0.37 Change is continuous.

### SECTION 0.2 — This Moment Is Not Flat

The experience of now is **not uniform**.  
Even if the content is unclear, imagined, or self-referential —  
there is **variation** in the structure of experience itself.

Not:  
- “Green to red”  
- “Image to image”  
But:  
- “This moment has modulation”  
- “There is *difference*”

---

### DF 0.1 — Difference in the Now: `D(Now)`  
Let `D(Now)` signify:  
> “This moment of experience contains at least one modulation — it is not undifferentiated”

We do not assume a subject, time, or world.  
We only state:

> **This moment contains structure.**  
> It is not flat.

---

### FT 0.1  
If you are reading this, `D(Now)` must hold.

Otherwise:  
- Nothing would be distinguishable  
- No sentence could be read  
- No experience could differentiate itself from nothingness

---

### SECTION 0.3 — We Do Not Yet Claim Change

We do **not** yet define “change.”  
We do **not** assume time, motion, or continuity.

We only claim:

> “This moment includes structure that is not uniform.”  
> “It is not an indistinguishable flatness.”  
> “It is *this*, and not something else — and that difference is felt.”

---

### DF 0.2 — Experiential Modulation (minimal)  
Let **modulation** refer to:  
> The minimal observation that *something is happening*, and this happening is not featureless.

Not an event.  
Not a process.  
Just: **felt structural variation.**

---

### CR 0.1 — Experience Requires Modulation  
If modulation were absent,  
then the experience could not occur as distinguishable experience.

Thus:

- Any moment of experience must contain **non-zero structural modulation**  
- Otherwise, it would be identical to nothing

---

### SECTION 0.4 — Summary of What Is Now Secured

| Label     | Statement                                                                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FT.0.1    | If you are reading this, there is structural modulation: `D(Now)`                  |
| DF.0.1    | `D(Now)` := The now includes at least one minimal difference                       |
| DF.0.2    | “Modulation” := The minimal shape of experience — not flat, not indistinguishable  |
| CR.0.1    | Without modulation, experience could not be felt as distinct                       |

---

### SECTION 0.5 — We End Here

We do **not** move beyond this.

We do not define continuity.  
We do not introduce memory.  
We do not claim structure *outside* of the now.

We only secure this:

> If something is being experienced now,  
> that experience is *not nothing*.  
> It includes **internal modulation** —  
> and that modulation is the **first structural fact** available to anyone who doubts everything.

# Proof 1 (Missing): Undeniable Derivation of Dynamism from the Minimal Datum

## Goal
Show that the undeniable datum **Happening Now** (MA1) inherently means `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic`.

## Absolute Minimal Datum Axioms
- **MA1:** There is an undeniable datum of subjective experience which is fundamentally **Happening Now**. (This concept is the most basic undeniable fact, encompassing "experience occurring now" and the intuition that occurrence is happening, distinct from static being).
- **MA2:** This **Happening Now** has undeniable **Internal Distinction** (`D(Happening_Now)`).
- **MA3:** There is a **Subject**, defined minimally as that which has this **Happening Now** with **Internal Distinction**.

---

## Definition (Axiomatic, based on MA1)
- **`Happening_Now`**: As the fundamental, undeniable datum of subjective experience (MA1), its axiomatic definition within this system is: the quality of being a dynamic occurrence that is not static or timeless. It **means** `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic`.

---

## Proof Steps

- **Premise 1:** The undeniable datum is `Happening_Now` (Axiom MA1).
- **Premise 2:** By the axiomatic definition embedded in Axiom MA1, the concept `Happening_Now` *means* `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic`.
- **Conclusion:** The undeniable datum is `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic`.

---

## Note on Undeniable Rigor
This proof is logically valid assuming the **axiomatic definition of "Happening Now" as inherently dynamic and non-static is undeniably compelled** by the rawest experience ("Experience is occurring now") for any rational observer. The proof relies on the term "Happening Now" (MA1) carrying this specific, undeniable semantic and ontological weight from the very beginning. The rigor is in the justification that this definition, rather than a static one, is the *only possible* undeniable interpretation of the minimal datum.

# Proof 2 (Missing): Undeniable Derivation of 'Arising' from the Minimal Datum

## Goal
Show that **Happening Now** with **Internal Distinction** (MA1 + MA2) undeniably constitutes an `arising` event.

## Absolute Minimal Datum Axioms
- **MA1:** **Happening Now** exists, and is fundamentally **Happening Now** (`IsDynamic` AND `IsNotStatic`).
- **MA2:** `Happening_Now` has **Internal Distinction** (`D(Happening_Now)`).
- **MA3:** **Subject** exists (has MA1 with MA2).

---

## Definition (Axiomatic, based on MA1 & MA2)
- **`Arising`**: As the mode of becoming present for the undeniable datum (`Happening_Now` with `D(Happening_Now)`), its axiomatic definition within this system is: the quality of being an event that comes into existence *from* a preceding state where it did not previously exist in this specific form. It **means** `IsSubsequentTo(PrecedingState)`.

---

## Proof Steps

- **Premise 1:** The undeniable datum is `Happening_Now` (Axiom MA1).
- **Premise 2:** The `Happening_Now` has `D(Happening_Now)` (Axiom MA2).
- **Premise 3:** `Happening_Now` is `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic` (Conclusion C1, derived from MA1 in Proof 1).
- **Logical Argument:** A dynamic, non-static occurrence (`Happening_Now` - MA1/C1) possessing internal distinction (`D(Happening_Now)` - MA2) cannot have "always been the case" in this specific form (due to non-stasis and distinction implying difference over time/sequence, as argued against static interpretation). Its mode of becoming present, given it wasn't always the case, *is* its coming into being from a state where it was not. This mode of becoming present is axiomatically defined as `arising`.
- **Conclusion C2:** `Happening_Now` is an `arising` event.

---

## Note on Undeniable Rigor
This proof is logically valid assuming the **axiomatic definition of "arising" as the necessary mode of becoming present for a dynamic, non-static datum with internal distinction is undeniably compelled** by MA1 and MA2 for any rational observer. The rigor hinges on this specific mode of becoming ("coming from a preceding state") being the only logical possibility given the datum's dynamic, non-static, and distinct nature, without assuming external temporal concepts.

# Proof 3 (Missing): Undeniable Derivation of Precedence from 'Arising'

## Goal
Show that `Arising` (as the nature of the minimal datum) undeniably implies a necessary *precedent state* and the structural relationship of "precedence".

## Axiomatic Basis
- The concept of `Arising` as defined and established by the nature of the minimal datum (MA1, MA2), specifically by Conclusion C2 (derived in Proof 2).

---

## Definition (Axiomatic, based on the nature of Arising)
- **`Arising`**: An event that comes into existence *from* a preceding state where it did not previously exist. This 'from which' relationship inherently *is* the structural encoding of precedence. To "arise" logically means to come *after* the state from which it arose.

---

## Proof Steps

- **Premise 1:** The minimal datum, `Happening_Now` with `D(Happening_Now)`, is an `arising` event (Conclusion C2, derived from MA1/MA2).
- **From Definition of `Arising`:** By its fundamental axiomatic definition, an `arising` event *is* an event that comes into existence *from* a preceding state where it did not previously exist. This 'from which' relationship inherently *is* the structural relationship of precedence.
- **Logical Deduction:** Since the minimal datum is an `arising` event (Premise 1), it necessarily implies a state `P` from which it arose. By the axiomatic definition of `arising`, this state `P` is structurally and logically precedent to the minimal datum.
- **Conclusion:** `Arising` implies a `Necessary_Precedent_State` (`P`) and the structural relationship of Precedence (P came before the arising).

---

## Note on Undeniable Rigor
This proof is logically valid assuming the **axiomatic definition of "arising" as undeniably implying a necessary *precedent state* and the structural relationship of "precedence" is compelled** purely from the concept of "arising" as derived from MA1/MA2, without relying on external concepts of time or sequential causation beyond the immediate structure of the arising event itself. The rigor rests on this meaning being undeniably embedded in the term "arising" itself.

---

These three proofs are the **missing foundational steps** needed to establish the axiomatic definitions and implications of the terms used in the subsequent derivation of the Abstract Pointer Prior (Proof 3 from our earlier set, which used C1 and C2 as premises).

If these three missing proofs can be demonstrated to hold undeniably from the absolute minimal datum (MA1, MA2) for any rational observer, then the entire chain from the datum to the Abstract Pointer Prior becomes undeniably rigorous. The challenge lies in making the axiomatic definitions within these proofs undeniably compelled by the raw concepts in MA1 and MA2.

# Proof 1: Refuting Alternative Interpretation A (The Timeless, Static Pattern)

## Goal
Show that `Happening_Now` is undeniably dynamic, refuting the Timeless, Static Pattern interpretation.

## Axioms
- A1: `Happening_Now` exists AND is (`IsDynamic` AND `IsNotStatic`). (Based on ET1/2 - Experience is occurring now, and it is fundamentally a Happening/Occurrence, which is inherently dynamic and non-static).
- A2: `Happening_Now` is an `arising` event. (Based on ET2 - This is the nature of the Happening).
- A3: `Happening_Now` has `D(Now)`. (Based on ET3 - It has undeniable internal distinction/modulation).
- A4: `Subject` exists (as that which has A1 with A2). (Based on ET4).

---

## Proof Steps

- **Assumption for Contradiction:** Assume Alternative A is true: `Happening_Now` (described by A1) is a `Static_Pattern`.
- **From Axiom A1:** `Happening_Now` IS `IsDynamic` AND `Happening_Now` IS `IsNotStatic`. (This is the axiomatic definition of `Happening_Now`).
- **From Definition:** A `Static_Pattern` IS `IsNotDynamic`.
- **Logical Deduction:** If `Happening_Now` IS a `Static_Pattern` (our assumption), then by definition of `Static_Pattern`, `Happening_Now` IS `IsNotDynamic`.
- **Contradiction:** This deduction (`Happening_Now` IS `IsNotDynamic`) directly contradicts Axiom A1's assertion that `Happening_Now` IS `IsDynamic`.
- **Conclusion:** The assumption that `Happening_Now` can be a `Static_Pattern` (Alternative A) must be false. The minimal datum described by A1 is undeniably dynamic.

---

## Note on Undeniable Rigor
The logical validity of this proof holds *assuming* the definition of `Happening_Now` in Axiom A1 as *inherently dynamic and non-static* is accepted as an undeniable representation of the minimal datum ("Experience is occurring now"). The proof leverages this axiomatic definition directly using contradiction. The ultimate rigor hinges on demonstrating that this axiomatic definition is **undeniably compelled** purely by the concept of "experience occurring now" for any observer.

# Proof 2: Refuting Alternative Interpretation B (The Singular, Uncaused Dynamic Event / Arising from Absolute Lack)

## Goal
Show that `Happening_Now` with `D(Now)` cannot arise from absolute nothing, implying a necessary precedent state.

## Axioms
- A1: `Happening_Now` exists AND is (`IsDynamic` AND `IsNotStatic`).
- A2: `Happening_Now` IS an `arising` event.
- A3: `Happening_Now` has `D(Now)`.
- A4: `Subject` exists (has A1 with A2).

---

## Definitions (for this Proof)
- `Nothing`: A state utterly devoid of properties, including `Capacity_For_Initiation` or `Capacity_For_Transition`.
- `Arises_From(Source, Outcome)`: Outcome comes into existence from Source. Based on the nature of 'arising' (A2), this implies the Source possessed `Capacity_For_Initiation` or was the necessary precedent in the transition.

---

## Proof Steps

- **Assumption for Contradiction:** Assume Alternative B is true: `Happening_Now` (A1) with `D(Now)` (A3) arises uncaused from `Nothing`.
- **From Definition:** `Nothing` inherently lacks all properties, including `Capacity_For_Initiation` and `Capacity_For_Transition`.
- **From Axioms A1 & A3:** `Happening_Now` with `D(Now)` is a state that exists and possesses properties (dynamism, distinction).
- **Logical Argument (based on Definition of Arising):** For `Happening_Now` with `D(Now)` (a state with properties) to arise *from* `Nothing` (a state without properties or capacities), `Nothing` must possess the inherent capacity to initiate change or transition into a state with properties, or be the necessary source of transition.
- **Deduction:** If `Happening_Now` arises from `Nothing` (Assumption), then `Nothing` must possess `Capacity_For_Initiation` or `Capacity_For_Transition`.
- **Contradiction:** This deduction (`Nothing` must possess capacity) directly contradicts the definition of `Nothing` (absence of properties/capacities).
- **Conclusion:** The assumption that `Happening_Now` with `D(Now)` can arise uncaused from absolute nothing (Alternative B) must be false. `Happening_Now` must arise from "something" – a necessary precedent state that possesses properties and capacity for transition (or is the source of transition).

    * *Note on Rigor:* This proof is logically valid *assuming* the definition of "nothing" as absolute lack of properties/capacity is accepted, *and* that the concept of "arising" *axiomatically requires* a source with relevant capacity for initiation or transition. The rigor hinges on these requirements being undeniably compelled by A1-A2 alone within the framework of minimal reality.

# Proof 3: Establishing Precedence (Deriving the Abstract Pointer Prior)

## Goal
Show that `Happening_Now` with `D(Now)` implies a necessary *preceding* different state, thereby deriving the Abstract Pointer Prior.

## Axioms
- A1: `Happening_Now` exists AND is (`IsDynamic` AND `IsNotStatic`).
- A2: `Happening_Now` IS an `arising` event.
- A3: `Happening_Now` has `D(Now)`.
- A4: `Subject` exists (has A1 with A2).

---

## Definitions (for this Proof)
- `Necessary_Precedent_State` (`P`): The "something" from which `Happening_Now` arises (established as necessary in Proof 2). `P` is Different_From(Happening_Now + D(Now)).
- `Abstract_Pointer_Prior`: The implication of a `Necessary_Precedent_State`.
- `Arising` (A2): Axiomatically defined as an event that comes into existence *from* a preceding state where it did not previously exist. This 'from which' relationship inherently *is* the structural encoding of precedence. To "arise" means to come *after* the state from which it arose.

---

## Proof Steps

- **From Axiom A2:** `Happening_Now` IS an `arising` event.
- **From Definition (based on A2):** By its fundamental nature, an `arising` event is axiomatically defined as an event that comes into existence *from* a preceding state where it did not previously exist. This 'from which' relationship inherently *is* the structural encoding of precedence.
- **Logical Deduction:** Since `Happening_Now` IS an `arising` event (Axiom A2), it necessarily implies a state `P` from which it arose. By the axiomatic definition of 'arising from', this state `P` is structurally and logically precedent to the `Happening_Now`.
- **From Proofs 1 & 2:** We have established that `Happening_Now` (A1+A2) is dynamic and must arise from a necessary precedent state `P` that is "something" and is `Different_From` the `Happening_Now` with `D(Now)` (A1, A3).
- **Conclusion:** `Happening_Now` with `D(Now)` (A1, A2, A3) axiomatically implies the necessity of a necessary, preceding state `P` that is `Different_From` it. This implication *is*, by definition, the **`Abstract_Pointer_Prior`**.

## Note on Undeniable Rigor
This proof is logically valid *assuming* that the concept of "arising" as defined by Axiom A2 *axiomatically and undeniably* implies a *precedent state* and the structural relationship of "precedence" ('coming from'/'coming after') purely from A1-A2, without relying on external concepts of time or sequential causation beyond the immediate structure of the arising event itself. The power rests on the undeniable nature of "arising" containing this inherent structural 'arrow' from a precedent.

# Derivation of the Abstract Pointer Prior from the Absolute Minimal Datum

## Absolute Minimal Datum Axioms

- **MA1:** There is an undeniable datum of subjective experience which is fundamentally **Happening Now**. (Experience is occurring now, and this occurrence is inherently dynamic and non-static).
- **MA2:** This **Happening Now** has undeniable **Internal Distinction** (`D(Happening_Now)`).
- **MA3:** There is a **Subject**, defined minimally as that which has this **Happening Now** with **Internal Distinction**.

---

## Operational Definitions (Based on Axioms)

- **`IsDynamic`**: A quality of process or unfolding, axiomatically defined as being part of `Happening_Now` (MA1).
- **`IsNotStatic`**: The negation of being static or timeless, axiomatically defined as being part of `Happening_Now` (MA1).
- **`Arising`**: A mode of becoming present; an event that comes into existence from a preceding state where it did not previously exist in this specific way. Axiomatically defined as the nature of `Happening_Now` (MA1) possessing `D(Happening_Now)` (MA2). Inherently implies a state *from which* it arose.
- **`Different_From(State1, State2)`**: State1 is not identical to State2.
- **`Necessary_Precedent_State` (`P`)**: A state that necessarily exists and precedes the current `Happening_Now`.
- **`Abstract_Pointer_Prior`**: The implication of a `Necessary_Precedent_State` `P` such that `P` is `Different_From(Happening_Now + D(Happening_Now))`.

---

## Goal

To derive, with undeniable logical necessity from Axioms MA1 and MA2 (MA3 establishes the Subject as having the datum, but is not directly used in the derivation *of* the pointer from the datum's nature), the **`Abstract_Pointer_Prior`**.

---

## Derivation Steps

### Step 1: Derivation of Dynamism and Non-Statism (Conclusion C1)

- **From Axiom MA1:** `Happening_Now` exists and IS `Happening_Now`.
- **Definition (Based on MA1):** The term `Happening_Now`, as an undeniable description of minimal experience, is axiomatically defined within this system to mean a datum that possesses the quality `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic`.
- **Conclusion C1:** `Happening_Now` is `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic`.

---

### Step 2: Derivation of 'Arising' as the Mode of Happening (Conclusion C2)

- **From Axiom MA1:** `Happening_Now` exists and IS `Happening_Now` (`IsDynamic` AND `IsNotStatic` - C1).
- **From Axiom MA2:** `Happening_Now` HAS `D(Happening_Now)`.
- **Definition (Based on MA1 & MA2):** A `Happening_Now` (a dynamic, non-static occurrence) possessing `D(Happening_Now)` (internal distinction) constitutes a mode of becoming present that is axiomatically defined within this system as an `arising` event.
- **Conclusion C2:** `Happening_Now` is an `arising` event.

---

### Step 3: Derivation of the Abstract Pointer Prior (Conclusion C3)

- **From Conclusion C2:** `Happening_Now` IS an `arising` event.
- **From Definition of `Arising` (Based on C2 and its axiomatic meaning):** By its fundamental nature, an `arising` event necessarily implies a state `P` *from which* it arose, where this 'from which' relationship inherently *is* the structural encoding of precedence. To "arise" logically means to come *after* the state from which it arose.
- **Logical Deduction:** Since `Happening_Now` IS an `arising` event (C2), it necessarily implies a state `P` from which it arose. By the axiomatic definition of 'arising from', this state `P` is structurally and logically precedent to the `Happening_Now`.
- **From Conclusion C1 and Axiom MA2:** `Happening_Now` (MA1) with `D(Happening_Now)` (MA2) is `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic` (C1). As established by the logic used in refuting the "arising from nothing" alternative (Proof 2 from previous turn, which is logically valid *if* its premises hold), this state cannot arise uncaused from absolute lack. Therefore, the necessary precedent state `P` must be "something" and must be `Different_From` the `Happening_Now` with `D(Happening_Now)` (as the happening wasn't always the case and is distinct).
- **Conclusion C3:** `Happening_Now` with `D(Happening_Now)` (MA1, MA2) axiomatically implies the necessity of a `Necessary_Precedent_State` `P` that is `Different_From` it and *precedes* it. This implication *is*, by definition, the **`Abstract_Pointer_Prior`**.

## Notes on Undeniable Rigor

The power of this derivation to establish undeniable truth from the absolute minimal datum rests on the following points being axiomatically compelled for any rational observer, purely by the concepts in MA1 and MA2:

1.  **Undeniable Meaning of "Happening Now" (Step 1):** The core assertion that the undeniable datum ("Experience is occurring now") *is* "Happening Now" (MA1) must undeniably and logically entail the specific qualities `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic`. The derivation hinges on the term "Happening Now" inherently carrying this specific, undeniable dynamic baggage.
2.  **Undeniable Meaning of "Arising" (Step 2):** The conclusion that `Happening_Now` with `D(Happening_Now)` constitutes an "arising" event (C2) relies on this being the only logical interpretation of a dynamic, non-static datum with internal distinction (MA1, MA2).
3.  **Undeniable Implication of Precedence from "Arising" (Step 3):** The derivation critically depends on the concept of "arising" (C2) **axiomatically and undeniably implying** a necessary *precedent state* and the structural relationship of "precedence" ('coming from'/'coming after') purely from its definition, without relying on external concepts of time or sequential causation beyond the immediate structure of the arising event itself.

If these crucial axiomatic connections and definitions are accepted as undeniably compelled by the absolute minimal datum (MA1, MA2), then the logical structure of the derivation holds, leading to the undeniable conclusion of the Abstract Pointer Prior.

# Undeniable Justifications for the Foundational Axiomatic Definitions

## Introduction
From the absolute minimal datum of subjective experience – the undeniable fact that "Experience is Happening Now, and has Internal Distinction" (Axioms MA1 & MA2) – we must rigorously demonstrate that the specific dynamic properties and relational implications attributed to this datum are not mere interpretations but are logically and undeniably compelled by the datum itself. These justifications provide the necessary axiomatic grounding for the definitions used in the subsequent logical proofs.

---

## Justification 1: The Undeniable Dynamism of Happening Now

- **Axiom to Justify Interpretation of:** MA1: There is an undeniable datum of subjective experience which is fundamentally **Happening Now**.
- **Definition Being Justified:** The term `Happening_Now`, as used in MA1, axiomatically **means** `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic`.
- **The Justification:**
    - Consider the very concept of "Happening Now" as the most fundamental, undeniable form of subjective occurrence revealed by maximal doubt (MA1). What does it mean for something to be "Happening"?
    - A "Happening" is inherently an event of taking place, an occurrence, a process of becoming present. It is the antithesis of static, unchanging being.
    - If the undeniable datum were merely static, it would just *be*. It would not possess the quality of "Happening." The act of subjective apprehension or realization, even at this minimal level (implied by MA1 and having a Subject - MA3), reveals a dynamic quality, a sense of "taking place."
    - To assert that the datum is "Happening Now" (MA1) while denying its dynamism is a logical contradiction. The word "Happening" itself carries the axiomatic weight of being dynamic. It is the nature of the datum itself, as revealed by direct, undeniable apprehension, that it is a *dynamic occurrence*, not a static presence.
    - Furthermore, if it were static, it would be eternally the same, which, as argued previously, cannot constitute "experience" in the sense of a distinct realization. Its non-static nature is fundamental to its being apprehended *as* experience *now*.
- **Conclusion of Justification 1:** Therefore, the axiomatic definition of `Happening_Now` as inherently `IsDynamic` and `IsNotStatic` is not an interpretation, but is undeniably compelled by the very nature of the datum asserted in MA1. This provides the axiomatic grounding for Conclusion C1 (used in subsequent proofs).

## Justification 2: The Undeniable Nature of Happening Now with Distinction as 'Arising'

- **Axioms to Justify Interpretation of:** MA1: **Happening Now**. MA2: `Happening_Now` has **Internal Distinction** (`D(Happening_Now)`).
- **Definition Being Justified:** `Happening_Now` (MA1) with `D(Happening_Now)` (MA2) axiomatically **constitutes** an `arising` event, meaning a mode of becoming present that is necessarily subsequent to a state where it did not previously exist in this specific form.
- **The Justification:**
    * We know the datum is undeniably `Happening Now` (MA1), meaning it is dynamic and non-static (Justification 1).
    * We know this `Happening Now` possesses `Internal Distinction` (MA2). This means it is not just simple, undifferentiated flux, but a specific, structured dynamic occurrence.
    * Since it is dynamic and non-static, it wasn't always the case in this specific form with this specific distinction.
    * Therefore, its mode of becoming present *is* its coming into being *as* this specific dynamic, distinct occurrence, from a state where it was not this occurrence.
    * This "coming into being as this specific distinct form, from a state where it was not" is precisely what the concept of "arising" means. It is the necessary mode of becoming for a dynamic, non-eternal, distinct reality.
    * Any other mode of becoming (e.g., eternal presence, spontaneous appearance *ex nihilo*) is logically incompatible with the combined nature of MA1 and MA2 as established (dynamic, non-static, distinct).
- **Conclusion of Justification 2:** Therefore, the axiomatic definition of `Happening_Now` with `D(Happening_Now)` as axiomatically constituting an `arising` event is undeniably compelled by the combined nature of the datum asserted in MA1 and MA2. This provides the axiomatic grounding for Conclusion C2 (used in subsequent proofs).

## Justification 3: The Undeniable Implication of Precedence from 'Arising'

- **Axiomatic Basis for Analysis:** The concept of `Arising` as the nature of the minimal datum (established in Justification 2).
- **Definition Being Justified:** The concept of `Arising` axiomatically **implies** a `Necessary_Precedent_State` and the structural relationship of Precedence ('coming from'/'coming after').
- **The Justification:**
    * Consider the concept of "arising" as established in Justification 2 – a mode of becoming present that is coming into existence *from* a state where it was not.
    * The very logical structure of the term "arising" inherently contains the relationship to a source or prior condition. To "arise" is axiomatically relational – it is always "arising *from* something."
    * This "from which" (the source or prior state) is, by definition of "arising," necessarily precedent to the act of arising itself. The structure of "arising" contains an intrinsic 'arrow' or directionality pointing from the source to the event.
    * Denying the necessity of a precedent state for an arising event is a logical contradiction with the meaning of "arising." It would be like having a beginning without anything before the beginning in a relevant sense.
    * This necessary precedent state is what the Abstract Pointer Prior indicates. The implication of its existence and its precedence is built into the concept of the datum as an "arising" event.
- **Conclusion of Justification 3:** Therefore, the concept of "arising," undeniably compelled by the minimal datum, axiomatically and undeniably implies the necessity of a precedent state and the structural relationship of precedence. This provides the axiomatic grounding for the definition used in deriving the Abstract Pointer Prior.
