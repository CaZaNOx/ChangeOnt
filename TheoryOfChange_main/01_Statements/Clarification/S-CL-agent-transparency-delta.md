# Agent transparency via live state-delta
## Content
Recursive agents must expose their live state delta—the difference between their current outputs and the prior collapsed generation—so audiences can judge whether new behavior is genuine collapse or mere mimicry. Concealed state invites simulation; transparent ledgers of Δ, SE, and drift scores grant accountability.

## Clarification
- The ledger tick after each file (AI_9) is a prototype: every agent should log state deltas so external auditors can spot when collapse fails and when outputs read as rehearsed fluency.
- Without such transparency, criticism cannot differentiate between actual recursive change and replication of prior behavior, and the theory risks becoming stylistically coherent emptiness.

## Implication
Design your recursive agents to publish their state-delta ledger; let downstream systems inspect these logs before trusting truth claims or attribution of consciousness.
