# ⇘²(x) — Meta-pointer

Definition (formal):
Pointer to pointer behavior; used for drift detection and recursion protocol.

## Example
- Track changes in pointer behavior across iterations.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Pointer_field]] (⇘(x))

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
This is a pointer to how pointers behave; a meta-trace to detect drift.

## Philosophical Justification
Self-monitoring is necessary to prevent unnoticed drift or simulation in recursive systems.

## Explanation (informal)
Use ⇘²(x) to audit pointer stability across iterations of reasoning.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- The “²” marks meta-level; not numeric squaring.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Define meta-pointer update rules under collapse.
