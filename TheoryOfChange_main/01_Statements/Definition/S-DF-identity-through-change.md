# Identity — metastable self-similarity across transformations
## Claim (formal)
An entity is a metastable, recursively self‑similar pattern of relations persisting across transformations within continuous change.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
“Being the same” is not about freezing; it is about preserving enough recognizable structure across ongoing difference. Identity is a pattern breathing through change.

## Philosophical Justification
In a world where Δ never ceases, persistence cannot be literal stasis. We therefore locate identity in what persists as recognizable under transformation: relational configurations that recur. This explains how persistence and novelty coexist: identity is achieved as recursive stabilization, not assumed as a primitive.

## Explanation (informal)
Self‑similarity summarizes that successive transformations map a pattern into close variants of itself (≈) under stated criteria; composition of such maps yields persistence over larger spans.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-FT-continuity-noncessation]] and [[S-DF-reach-relation]]: continuity and reach support the stitching of recognizable configurations into a persistent pattern.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Let T_k be transformations in LocalReach.
Identity(P) := ∀k∈K: T_k(P) ≈ P, with K spanning a persistence window.
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Criteria for ≈ must be stated (invariants, tolerances ε, σ(ε)).
- Identity ≡ is context‑dependent but disciplined by declared invariants.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Define thresholds for identity recognition; relate to SE and entropy.
