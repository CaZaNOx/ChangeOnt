# Summary — Hypotheticals (operator/field emergence sketches)
Core idea
- Outlines how identity, language, and logic might “breathe” from Δ‑phase dynamics; proposes emergence sketches without formal derivations.

Key points
- Identity/self‑similarity from Δ stabilization; language as phase‑resonance signaling; logical operators as survival strategies.

Fit to core
- Conceptually aligns with identity/SE/σ(ε), but requires precise definitions/benchmarks before promotion.

Next steps
- Extract one concrete operator (e.g., AND as co‑stabilization) and prototype in a small dynamical system.
