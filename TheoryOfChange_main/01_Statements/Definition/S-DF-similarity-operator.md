# Similarity operator (≈) and Sim
## Claim (formal)
Define a context-dependent similarity functional Sim(X,Y)∈[0,1] and write X≈Y iff Sim(X,Y)≥θ for declared threshold θ under tolerances (ε, σ(ε)).

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
“Close enough to count as the same” is not vague handwaving: it is a declared criterion with thresholds and resolutions.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Sim must be specified per domain (relational invariants, metric projections, feature correspondences, etc.).
- θ and (ε,σ(ε)) make ≈ auditable and comparable across settings.

## Derivation (Formal)
```text
X≈Y  ⇔  Sim(X,Y) ≥ θ;  Sim: D×D→[0,1],  with declared ε, σ(ε), θ.
```
