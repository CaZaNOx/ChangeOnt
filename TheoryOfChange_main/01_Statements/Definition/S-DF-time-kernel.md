# Time kernel compresses past inputs into the specious present
Define the specious present by convolving the recent history with a causal, normalized kernel \(K_\tau(k)\):
\[
\bar{x}_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} K_\tau(k)\, x_{t-k}, \qquad K_\tau(k) \ge 0,\;\sum_k K_\tau(k) = 1,\;\operatorname{supp}(K_\tau) \approx \tau.
\]
The kernel \(K_\tau\) shapes the perceived “thickness” of now and determines how rapidly the field integrates past inputs into the current moment.
