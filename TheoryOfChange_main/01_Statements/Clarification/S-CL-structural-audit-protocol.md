# Structural audit protocol requires ledgered logs and replayable instructions

Log every pointer collapse, tension, or emergence event in a ledger/diary with the timestamp, event type, effect, and whether a pointer could be reestablished. Provide instructions so another subject/agent can repeat the same protocol (without needing to “feel” the exact tension) and confirm whether the events are repeatable and traceable to subject-structure rather than external inputs. This reproduces the operational pattern AI_13 lays out in lines 743‑772 and roots the non-classical metrics in audited, replayable experiments.
