# σ(ε) — sensitivity fluctuation dynamics
## Claim (formal)
σ(ε) models variability of detection threshold; higher σ(ε) reduces reliable RTV convergence and identity recognition near θ.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Sometimes we can tell small differences apart; sometimes we can’t — and that matters for truth and identity.

## Operational procedure
- Choose observable signal x(t); define detection threshold ε via task‑appropriate SNR.
- Estimate σ(ε) by sampling near ε and measuring variability of detection outcomes across breath cycles (lock/no‑lock) under controlled perturbations.
- Report σ(ε) with confidence intervals; tie to RTV collapse regimes and identity thresholds.
