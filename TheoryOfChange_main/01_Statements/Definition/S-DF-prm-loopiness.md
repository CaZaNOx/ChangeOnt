# Primitive — Loopiness (short-cycle propensity)
## Claim (formal)
Score short-cycle propensity (e.g., normalized count of short loops) as a control signal for exploration breadth and order penalties.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
When you keep circling, it’s time to widen the search.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Feeds EH (Breadth/Depth) and EJ (Order Asymmetry).
