>    Similar examples hold for CoE(x) where x is negating ES, SoE, CoE or combinations thereof like E(x,y).
> 2) A subject thinking "I am not thinking"="MoE($\lnot$thinking)" translates to (S, MoE(thinking), "MoE($\lnot$thinking)"). This doesn't break the tuple like in case 1. Instead it is a PC because structure of SoE relevant for the specific CoE(x) is negated. In this example the structure that allows thinking of statements is negated. If thinking wasn't structurally possible the statement could never be thought. This provides us with the insight that relevant SoE supersedes specific CoE making CoE(x) false.
