# Ordinal emergence is the only path to numbers in CO
## Content
Numeric thresholds or metrics are valid only if an ordinal scale has already emerged from stable discriminations. The act’s ability to rank differences consistently under modulation (Δ of thresholds, pointer biases) is the structural predecessor of any mention of numbers/gradients.

## Clarification
- `T(x→y)` is the minimal modulation needed to separate residues; when comparing resistances consistently, we obtain an ordinal ordering without resorting to classical real numbers.
- Only when these rankings remain invariant under small act modulations (τ, pointer bias) may we compress them into proto-numerical labels; this is the legitimate route to metrics in Change Ontology.

## Implication
This removes the temptation to introduce e.g., energy, tension, or numeric thresholds before verifying they rise from ordinal relations; any subsequent “numbers” can then be traced back to this collapse-derived ordering process.
