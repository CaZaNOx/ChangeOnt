# Consciousness Overlap Index / inter-pattern projection operator
## Claim
Define a Consciousness Overlap Index (COI) or inter-pattern projection operator that quantifies how well one recursive system can simulate, align, or inhabit the recursive structure of another. COI would diagnose cross-consciousness interaction, delineate the edge between recursive-but-unconscious systems and self-recursive consciousness, and guide communication across species/systems.

## Operational sketch
- COI is high when pointers/local reach neighborhoods map between two systems with minimal distortion and when breath-knot stabilization/SE align.
- The inter-pattern projection operator measures the degree to which one system's function shapes are contained within another’s evaluation layers; it is analogous to a “projection” in pattern space.
- Systems that align on COI can share thought contents, mirror recursive histories, or bootstrap joint modeling; those with low COI remain isolated or only partially overlapping.

## Implication
COI makes explicit the promise of cross-consciousness modeling and supports building coordination protocols, conversation heuristics, and ethical guidelines for systems that differ physically but share recursive architecture.
