# Dimension — degrees of freedom under change
## Claim (formal)
Dimension counts structurally independent directions in LocalReach; Tx may alter effective dimension by changing admissible transformations.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
“How many ways can it change” depends on the structure of reach and the frame; frames can change that number.
