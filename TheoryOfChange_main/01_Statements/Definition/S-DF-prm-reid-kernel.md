# Primitive — ReID kernel (cross-time same-ness under gauge)
## Claim (formal)
Define a kernel K_reid(x_t, x_s; Γ, ε) measuring identity across time under gauge transport and tolerance ε; supports stable tracking and closure.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
To follow a thing through change, we need a way to recognize it when it’s not exactly the same.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Used by identity element (EC) and OPS/J4a (ReID closure).
