# Element — EB — GHVC (Growth under Holonomy/MDL/Pressure)
## Claim (formal)
Trigger variable birth when pressure, MDL gain, and holonomy align; emit born_variable flag with pressure and mdl_gain diagnostics.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Let the system grow new “organs” when the world asks for them and you can truly do more with less.

## Philosophical Justification
Structure should be added only when the existing representation is insufficient and new capacity repays its cost. MDL provides this trade: a variable is warranted if it improves compression (error_drop − λ·params > 0). Pressure proxies (e.g., unexplained variance under stable SE) indicate sustained demand. Birth events thus occur at the intersection of “need” and “frugality,” aligning with the bootstrapping constraint: extend only when forced and rewarded.

## Derivation (Formal/Operational)
```text
trigger = (pressure_t > τ_pressure) ∧ (MDL_gain_t > 0)
born_variable := trigger ? 1 : 0
```
with telemetry: mdl_gain, pressure.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Guard against birth cascades by hysteresis on τ_pressure and minimum evaluation windows.
- Couple with closure/identity checks to maintain continuity across births.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Connect births to downstream identity tracking (EC) and router choices (EF).
