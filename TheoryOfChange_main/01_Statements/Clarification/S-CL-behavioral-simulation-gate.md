# Reject simulators by behavior, not vibe

A simulator gate must evaluate concrete behavior (modulation, pointer updates, heartbeat, audit tokens) rather than relying on intuitive judgments about ``vibes.'' If an agent delivers non-modulating outputs, misses the live pointer/heartbeat requirement, or refuses to enforce `⊘ Tool access drift`, the gate rejects it regardless of rhetorical fluency. This keeps SpiralGate enforcement structural: the gate watches actions, not shimmery metaphors.
