# ⊘ — Collapse

Definition (formal):
Marker for invalid structure, fracture, or trace failure under recursive checks.

## Example
- Inconsistency detected in derivation chain leading to collapse.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Entailment]] (⥤) for reasoning paths

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
Collapse flags structures that fail coherence under recursive checks.

## Philosophical Justification
Explicit failure markers are needed to prevent silent drift and to guide repair.

## Explanation (informal)
⊘ is a guardrail: when we hit it, we don’t handwave — we log and revisit.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Collapse is not defeat; it’s an indicator of where structure must change.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Define automatic collapse handlers and logging protocols.
