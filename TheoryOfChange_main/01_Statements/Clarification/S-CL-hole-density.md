# Variable granularity increases Gödel hole density around macro predictions

As you add finer-grained variables (physics → chemistry → biology), the density of Gödel holes about higher-level phenomena rises: smaller base units produce more structural gaps and unclosable predictions. You can estimate a "hole density function" for any theory—count how many unresolvable higher-level predictions arise per variable introduced. This explains why reductionism fails to predict emergent structure even while describing micro-detail: closure only happens by coarse-graining, and each micro-level addition multiplies the holes.
