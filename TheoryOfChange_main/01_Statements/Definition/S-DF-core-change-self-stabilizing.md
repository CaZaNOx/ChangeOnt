# Core Change — self-stabilizing change
## Claim (formal)
Change can locally stabilize itself into persistent modulations without ceasing; identity arises as such self‑stabilizing change.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Stability is how change behaves when it reinforces a configuration; it’s still change.
