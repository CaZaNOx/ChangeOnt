# Treat Langton’s Ant / Mandelbrot analogies as structural maps, not identities

Langton’s Ant, Mandelbrot fractals, and Gödel-hole spaces provide a rich vocabulary for labeling the global field of possibilities, stabilities, and forbidden zones that a recursive agent explores—but only if you treat them as structural maps rather than literal equivalences. The analogy holds when you can point to the meta-constraint layer (holes, boundaries, sensitive regions), describe which agent/environment parameters carve specific regions, and audit how those regions shift under variable changes. When you fail to map the analogy to actual path logs—when you stop at “it looks like a Mandelbrot”…—you slip into metaphor. Keep the comparison alive by showing how each ant/environment pair produces its “meta-map” of stable, chaotic, and hole-laden territories; otherwise drop the claim from the active documentation.
