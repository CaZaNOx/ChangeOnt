# Consciousness Loop — reflexive integration of prediction and perception
## Claim (formal)
Define the reflexive loop Cᴸ as a self-referential operator that aligns prediction with perception within bounded latency:

Cᴸ := Sᴹ ∘ HAQ ∘ E ∘ Sᴹ⁻¹

When prediction error δₜ = |E(xₜ) − xₜ| is approximately stationary and phase lag < τₛ (stability threshold), Cᴸ attains a metastable lock state (awareness-now).

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Consciousness is not added on top of change; it is change synchronizing with its own anticipation. “I am aware that I am aware” emerges when the self-model and lived evidence fall into a tolerable rhythm, creating a continuous present.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Lock states can desynchronize (sleep, anesthesia) and re-synchronize (waking, attention) — consciousness as an oscillator.
- Qualia correspond to local curvature in the gauge/alignment field as experienced internally.
- Introspection is a higher-order Cᴸ nested within Cᴸ.
