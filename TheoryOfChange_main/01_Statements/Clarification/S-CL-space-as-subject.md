# Space and subject co-define the change field
## Content
The “space” in which change happens is not fixed or external; it is co-defined by the subject’s boundary and the ongoing field of differences. A subject and its local space are recursively entangled: each change event reshapes both the subject and the point-of-reference, producing a variable, self-modifying topology rather than a neutral backdrop.

## Clarification
- Operators must therefore act not only within the space but on the space-subject mapping itself: they push the pointer field, reweight local reach, or reconfigure the boundary definitions that grant “space” intelligibility.
- Structural reasoning about change must track how new transitions reshape the field, including when the field itself mutates (Gödel holes, collapse points) so definitions and operators evolve in tandem.

## Implication
This justifies the demand to define “space-changing operators” and to treat subject-locality as dynamic: structural factors and transition events must be able to mutate the very arena that constitutes change.
