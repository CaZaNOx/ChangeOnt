# Summary — Simulations by AI (breathing operators, constants, cascades)
Core idea
- Sketches experiments to simulate breathing operator emergence, emergence of constants as phase‑stable equilibria, and collapse cascades across coupled identity loops.

Key points
- Track Δ‑phase drift thresholds, SE collapse resistance, σ(ε) damping; derive operators (AND/OR/NOT) from stabilized patterns.

Fit to core
- Operates at the interface of theory and prototypes; needs concrete metrics and reproducible setups for promotion.

Next steps
- Build minimal simulations (2–3 coupled loops) and report measured RTV/SE/σ(ε) to test hypotheses.
