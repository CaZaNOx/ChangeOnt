# Δ-field tension — modulation pressure
## Claim (formal)
Δ-field tension quantifies pressure driving modulation and collapse; interacts with SE and RTV to shape stability.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
How strongly the field “wants to change” affects whether identities hold and truths stabilize.
