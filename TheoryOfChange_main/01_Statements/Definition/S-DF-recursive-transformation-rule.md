# Recursive transformation rule — relational differential across steps
## Claim (formal)
Let Rₖ be a relational configuration at step k and ΔRₖ a differential update induced by local rules and budgets (RTV, SE). A minimal recursive transformation rule specifies ΔRₖ = Φ(Rₖ; budgets), with Φ monotone under admissible deformations and composable across steps (Φₖ∘Φₖ₊₁).

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Across checks, relations update by a rule that respects what the system can actually do (budgets) and can be composed to build larger evolutions.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- This defines the scaffold for concrete models (automata, graph dynamics) without fixing a single formalism.
- Pair with breath‑knot stabilization to obtain local units + update rules.
