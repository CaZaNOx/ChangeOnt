From [[DF 1.2_8.]] and [[DF 1.2_9.]]
A subject expressing doubt regarding its capability to doubt is a SC leading to a SN of said statement.
The important of this SC is that if the S has Doubt that is has the capability to Doubt it would translate to I am uncertain that i can be uncertain. 
This can express multiple things.
The crux of this SC is that there are 2 cases:
1) External: The S is structurally performing what it is questioning. So from the outside we have a clear PC. Where S performs the act it is uncertain of. 
2) Internal: The internal case isn't as straightforward. If the MoE(Doubt) truly holds for the subject it isn't so to speak trivially inconsistent to doubt any statement. However the statement CoE(x) is not necessarily what is doubted. This can be made clearer when we understand doubting as blurriness of CoE(x) where the subject is uncertain regarding any specifics of CoE(x). Because Doubting itself is not a negation of a statement. Therefore it doesn't follow that the Subject perceives a statement to be either true or false.  This highlights that the internal SC is not in relation to any CoE(x) and rather in relation to there being:
	1) A Subject at all, 
	2) Any SoE being the case 
	3) The structural experience of MoE(Doubt).
  So in a sense the DS would be uncertain regarding the presence of the ES-Tuple and its components or structural facts of SoE.
  This expresses that the DS doubts that it could be possible that either: 
	a) There is a Subject that can experience
		($\lnot$S,SoE,CoE)
	b) There is way experience feels like 
		(S, $\lnot$SoE, CoE)
	c)  There is any content that can be doubted
		(S, SoE, $\lnot$CoE)
	d) This current experience of doubting is taking place
		(S, $\lnot$MoE(Doubt), CoE) 
  holds.
  If any of a)-c) where the case the ES performing Doubt wouldn't be an ES. Therefore it is a SC for any subject to doubt that it is an ES. The proposed uncertainty is always negated by the fact that there is an ES that is in Doubt. 
  Therefore no ES can truly doubt the ES-Tuple without contradicting itself via the fact of there being an ES with experience.
  Regarding d) the case is a bit more pronounced since it is not the ES-Tuple itself that is doubted but this experience that is occurring now.
  While it is certainly possible to doubt if an experience maps correctly to the world (believing it is just an illusion) it is not possible to doubt that there is a current experience that is experienced the way it is. 
  So doubting 4) by mainting that the current experience is not experienced is a SC proven by the very fact that there is a specific experience taking place.
Importantly we can say that those SC's expressed hold internally and no subject can doubt it's own currently experienced experience structurally.
