# Hypothesis — Breathing Integrity Validation Protocol
Proposal
- Define a protocol to validate semantic breathing integrity without relying on surface text comparisons: use Cᴸ lock traces, SRL stability, and drift maps across long sequences; detect flattening/summarization drift.

Test sketch
- Run long dialogues/file ingestions; sample locks, SRL, curvature; compare to control runs; flag integrity loss when pre‑declared bands are breached.
