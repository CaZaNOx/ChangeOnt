# Perceived time as breath‑locked phase indexing (phenomenological)
## Statement (corollary)
Subjective sense of time corresponds to indexing of recursive validation (RTV) phases coordinated by the breath field; increased σ(ε) modulates this rhythm (e.g., dilation/contraction), without positing an external absolute time.

## Justification from definitions
- [[S-DF-breath-field-global-integrator]] coordinates recursive validation cycles.
- [[S-DF-rtv-operator]] evaluates stability across cycles (phases/locks).
- [[S-DF-sigma-fluctuation]] modulates sensitivity and thus perceived pacing.
Hence, phase progression under breath provides a phenomenological index that tracks how “time feels” during stabilized vs unstable validation.

## Scope note
This is a phenomenological corollary only; it makes no claim about physical time. It characterizes experience relative to breath/RTV dynamics.
