# Element — EJ — Order Asymmetry
## Claim (formal)
Emit per‑action order‑sensitive penalties and votes using graded co‑logic, along with loopiness/arisal indicators.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Do the right things in the right order; doing them backward can undo what you gained.

## Philosophical Justification
Change is path‑dependent: AB may open opportunities that BA closes. Penalizing 2‑cycles/backtracks formalizes this intuition and reduces oscillations that waste effort or erase gains. Casting penalties as graded votes (co‑logic) integrates order awareness into decision aggregation.

## Derivation (Formal/Operational)
```text
penalty_map[a] := risk(returns_to_prev) + risk(undoes_gain)
vote_map := grade_to_votes(penalty_map)
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Calibrate penalties to avoid over‑discouraging necessary reversals (repair steps).

## Next Steps in Chain
- Evaluate arisal signals and loopiness trends under EJ to verify harm reduction.
