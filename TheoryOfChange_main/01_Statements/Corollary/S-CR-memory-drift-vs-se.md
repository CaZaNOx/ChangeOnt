# Memory drift increases as SE decreases (and with higher σ(ε))
## Statement (corollary)
The stability of reactivatable memory traces declines as stabilization energy (SE) falls and as σ(ε) rises; drift precedes collapse of integration across experiences.

## Justification from definitions
- [[S-DF-memory-trace-integration]]: memory traces integrate across experiences via reactivation.
- [[S-DF-stabilization-energy]]: higher SE corresponds to more reliable loop persistence.
- [[S-DF-sigma-fluctuation]]: larger σ(ε) reduces reliable convergence.
Therefore, lower SE and higher σ(ε) jointly increase drift of memory traces and reduce robust integration.
