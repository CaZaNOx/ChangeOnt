# Change is ontically prior to being
## Claim (formal)
All existence‑claims presuppose Δ; therefore Δ is more fundamental than “being.”

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
To say “something exists,” you already rely on difference; so change is more basic than being. “Being” is how stabilized change looks from the inside; it is not prior to the possibility of difference.

## Philosophical Justification
Without difference, “being” cannot register; the intelligibility of existence depends on change. This redirects ontology: instead of starting from substances that happen to change, we start from change that supports stabilized patterns we call substances. It explains why identity and persistence always require a story about what is conserved through transformation.

## Explanation (informal)
Positions process/Δ as the primitive from which identity and ontology arise.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-FT-immediate-datum]]: any assertion of being requires discriminable difference; hence Δ is prior.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Existence assertions require discriminable predicates ⇒ require Δ
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- proof: conceptual analysis; see identity under change (future).

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Does not deny “being”; rather, it grounds being in change.
- See symbol: [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]]

## Next Steps in Chain
- suggest: formalize identity-through-change metrics.
