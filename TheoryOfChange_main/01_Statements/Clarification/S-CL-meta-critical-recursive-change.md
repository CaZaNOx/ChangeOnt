# Meta‑Critical Principle — criticism must terminate in new structure
Clarifies the role of criticism within recursive evaluation: identification of tension should lead to constructive transformation (updated structure, clearer thresholds, or explicit abstention), rather than indefinite paralysis or destructive loop.

Philosophical justification
- Within the evaluation surface, persistent criticism without constructive movement reflects collapse or mis‑tuned criteria; under SRL, valuable criticism increases structural recurrence likelihood by sharpening distinctions or repairing invariants.

Operational guidance
- Tie each critical finding to a follow‑up transformation (refactor definitions, add abstain gates, or widen Tx framing).
- If no constructive path exists under declared ε, σ(ε), mark unknown/abstain and stop per limits‑and‑rigor.
