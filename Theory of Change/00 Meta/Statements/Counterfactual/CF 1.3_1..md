From [[SF 1.3_2.]]
1) If the experience didn't *wasn't the case* then there would be no experience structurally negating the fact that there is a DS. This is a SC.
2) If *this experience* isn't the case
   it either implies that:
	1) a different experience  (not *this experience*) is the case. Meaning there was still an experience that is the case but because we didn't formulate  specifics of the experience this would be nonsensical. It also requires a DS to differentiate experiences. This contradicts the definition of the DS. So the *this* in the statement doesn't mean the DS points to a specific experience itself and rather that there is a experience that is the case.(whatever specific experience it might be) 
	2) something is the case but it wasn't an *experience* negating the DS as subject and breaking the ES-Tuple. This is a SC
	3) the DS wouldnt expierience *an experience* therfore negating the DS being a subject and breaking the ES-Tuple. This is a SC
