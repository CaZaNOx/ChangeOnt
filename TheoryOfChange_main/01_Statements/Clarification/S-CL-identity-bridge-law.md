# Close the hard problem by equating phenomenal feel with global change-of-change

Formalize the identity bridge by positing that phenomenal feel at time \(t\) is identical to the globally available change-of-change on the self-model within window \(\tau\). This bridge must hold like a constitutive law, and a “no inversion” theorem ensures that any system matching the tuple \((G^*, U, B, A, \tau)\) across the window cannot have different phenomenology. This frames the hard problem as a testable conjecture rather than a mystical gap—if the bridge fails, look for failure cases; if it holds, the ontology achieves a Maxwell-like identity between structure and presence.
