# CO Overview (why, what, how)

**Motivation.** Everyday ML assumes a mostly-fixed world; change is an afterthought. But frontiers (markets, biology, language, interaction) are *controlled by change*. CO proposes:
- **Ontology**: Change first. “Objects” are habits of re-identification.
- **Math**: Build from **eventlets** (minimal observed contrasts), **paths**, **bends** (τ-tolerance), **equivalence closure**, **quotient Q**, and a **gauge** that warps perceived costs while preserving topology.
- **Mechanisms**: HAQ (a), spawn (b), κ (c), edge-of-chaos (d), attention-as-potential (e), LLN on Q (f), density header (g), meta-flip (h), complex turn (i).
- **Headers**: detect “collapse-to-classical” vs. change-heavy regimes.

**Classical is a special case.** When entropy/variance of outcomes conditioned on Q are tiny, a classical solver suffices; CO **freezes** adaptation and re-enables it when the regime drifts.

**Falsifiability.** Each mechanism ships with a decisive falsifier (e.g., HAQ flip sharpness and AU-regret vs. matched baselines on renewal tasks).
