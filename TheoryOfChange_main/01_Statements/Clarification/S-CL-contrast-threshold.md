# Contrast threshold and detection boundary for recurrence
## Content
The minimal local change-detection boundary is captured by a contrast statistic CCC computed over the edge between two experiences. If CCC exceeds a threshold τ, the system recognizes a new difference and commits to a memory witness; CCC collapsing to zero means detection fails. This boundary supplies the earliest ordinal structure by marking when change is distinguishable enough to count.

## Clarification
- Estimate τ by tracking the ratio of signal (contrast between successive Δ windows) to noise (entropy) and verifying stability under drift.
- If τ drifts toward zero or the contrast statistic becomes unbounded, the boundary lacks robustness and the detection claim is invalid.

## Implication
This answer addresses the modest test requested in AI₆ (define the contrast statistic and witness) and allows us to treat “noticing change” as an empirical threshold rather than a tautological claim.
