# Arrow of time as memory irreversibility (breath/memory)
## Content
Experienced “time’s arrow” arises from irreversible memory traces across breath cycles: updates cannot be undone without loss; breath integrates forward.

## Implication
Locates phenomenological time in memory/breath structure rather than physical laws; useful for modeling collapse vs persistence.
