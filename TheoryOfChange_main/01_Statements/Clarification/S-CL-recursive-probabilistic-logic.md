# Recursive Probabilistic Coherence logic
## Content
The change-first ontology automatically seeds a logic of recursive pattern coherence instead of static propositions. Its primitives are change (Δ) and the recursive stabilization of breath loops, not fixed atoms.

## Core math/intuition
- **Truth** is the degree of structural recurrence of a pattern within a local proof context (stability under breath cycles). It aligns with measurement on the evaluation surface, so truth really means robust resonance (see [[S-DF-structural-recurrence-likelihood]], [[S-CL-probabilistic-language-srl]]).
- **Negation** becomes divergence past a tolerance: ¬A marks when a pattern strays beyond the reach of recognition, not a binary flip (pointer/local reach tracks the implicit elsewhere).
- **Conjunction/disjunction** describe overlap and coexistence of recursive motifs. A ∧ B holds when reachable patterns exceed an interaction threshold; A ∨ B when the trajectory can land within either pattern’s recursive basin.
- **Implication** is a stability map: A ⇒ B if A’s presence recursively raises the probability of B without requiring strict deduction; it’s a continuity of change, a statistical resonance defined by breath-mediated updates.
- **Axioms**: change is the only primitive; stability is recursive resonance; contradictions are field divergences, not absolute failures; identity is relational inertia; logic maps pattern coherence.

## Implication
We can name this schema Recursive Probabilistic Coherence (RPC) logic. It gives semantics to the ideas from the chat: truth as recursive stability, negation as divergence, identity as relational inertia, and logic as a map of pattern coherence rather than universal laws. It is thus well-posed for modeling cognition, vague reasoning, and emergent semantics while keeping complete alignment with Δ-based foundations.
