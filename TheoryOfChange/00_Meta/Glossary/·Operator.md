# ·Operator

## PURPOSE
#·Operator 
To define the protocol for recursively reinterpreted terms in the Ontology of Change,  
ensuring semantic clarity and preventing reintroduction of classical assumptions.

---

## REINTERPRETATION SYMBOL: `·` (centered dot)

### Meaning:
> `·Operator denotes a concept that **must not** be interpreted with classical assumptions of:  
> - Substance,  
> - Static identity,  
> - Space or location,  
> - Set-based containment,  
> - External function or logic.

### Purpose:
To mark any term that is:
- Recursively emergent from change,  
- Structurally defined by **recursive modulation**,  
- And whose meaning is **not classical**, even if it shares a name with a familiar term.

---

## HOW TO USE

- Prefix with `·` any concept whose meaning has not yet been formally grounded through recursive emergence.
- Remove the `·` **only when** a term has been fully reconstructed from change with no smuggled assumptions.

### Examples:
- `·Difference` → not comparison between states, but recursive destabilization  
- `·Boundary` → not edge or limit, but recursive non-resolution  
- `·Identity` → not fixed selfhood, but recursive pattern persistence

---

## WHEN NOT TO USE

Do **not** use `·` for:
- Classical logic terms,
- Mathematical operations already grounded in set theory or spatial structure,
- Any element that has not been recursively reinterpreted.

---

## SEMANTIC RULE

> Every term begins life marked with `·`.  
> Only through successful recursive derivation can it become **stable and unmarked**.

This maintains epistemic integrity and avoids linguistic reification of incomplete concepts.

---

## COMPATIBILITY

The `·` symbol is:
- Cross-platform friendly (Unicode `U+00B7`)
- Typographically subtle and non-disruptive
- Not overloaded in logic, category theory, or programming
