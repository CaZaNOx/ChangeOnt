# Attention fields as layered, thresholded recursive maps
## Content
Attention is not a single spotlight but a hierarchy of recursive integration fields. High-level fields are slow, abstract, and intentionally cumulative; low-level fields are fast, structured, and tuned for survival-critical cues. Mid-level modulators mediate transitions, gating when a fast override preempts a slow deliberate pattern.

## Clarification
- At any moment the “house” and “tree” coexist within the wave, but different thresholds determine which crosses into conscious focus. Lower-level thresholds keep emergency stimuli accessible even while high-level attention consumes most resources.
- Recursive convergence compresses time when the high-level field dominates; rapid shifts into primitive fields stretch subjective time and emphasize reactive survival loops.
- The field hierarchy explains divided focus, multi-agent attention, and returns control to breath-mediated stabilization: crossing a threshold is equivalent to reconfiguring pointer/local reach weightings when recursive pressure spikes.

## Implication
This layered view accounts for flow, sudden fear overrides, and gradient attention without assuming magical switches. Attention becomes a set of weighted threshold maps over LocalReach neighborhoods, continuously reconfigured by breath and RTV updates.
