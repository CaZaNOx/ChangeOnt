# ↶(x) — Local pointer to prior

Definition (formal):
Subject-local pointer to prior internal state/configuration.

## Example
- Used in subject-local trace without field-level implications.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Pointer_field]] (⇘(x))

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
The subject’s own “trace” to earlier internal states.

## Philosophical Justification
Subjective continuity relies on accessible internal traces, not just field-level ones.

## Explanation (informal)
Use ↶(x) inside subject-centered derivations and protocols.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Local pointers can disagree with field pointers in drift cases.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Define reconciliation rules for ↶(x) vs ⇘(x).
