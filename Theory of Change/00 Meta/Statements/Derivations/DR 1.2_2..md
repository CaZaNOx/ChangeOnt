If there would be no E$_x\subset$ E$_{all}$
 the subject would experience everything combined at once.
This would mean that different experiences 
$\exists$x,y: E$_x\neq$E$_y$ wouldn't be possible.
Further it would also mean that at the same time CoE(x) and CoE($\lnot$x) would be experienced and that all different MoE would hold in the same instance so Doubt(x) and Trust(x) would both hold.
This would lead us to the following conclusions
1) CoE would negate/cancel itself out meaning there is no CoE this is a SC because we experience specific content
2) All MoE would be the case negating them being MoE because MoE are understood as different experiences of the same content. If all MoE hold then CoE(x) would be experienced exactly the same way. SC of concept MoE.
3) There would be no different experiences
