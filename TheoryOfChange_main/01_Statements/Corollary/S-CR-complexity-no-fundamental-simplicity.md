# No fundamental simplicity (complexity framing)
## Claim (formal)
Persistence emerges from structured self‑similarity and stabilization, not from irreducible simplicity; identity is achieved by recursion.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Simplicity is not the ground; structured persistence is — and it’s dynamic.
