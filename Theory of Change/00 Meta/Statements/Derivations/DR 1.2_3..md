From [[CR 1.2_18.]] and [[CR 1.2_20.]]
$\lnot$Now(x) doesn't imply that x is in Now. 
Because x specifies an abstract location and x doesn't necesarly need to be an experience.
Expressed differently if there is an x that is not experience it still holds that x is not in Now(x)
We state:
If $\exists$ x: x$\not\subseteq$ E $\to$ x$\not\in$Now 
and because 
Now(x)$\subset$Now
it follows that
x$\not\in$Now(x)
We express this as  
$\lnot$Now(x)  
We can formulate this as:
x is not in the now because it isn't an experience
