From [[FT 1.2_1.]]
1) There is no subject ($\lnot$S, SoE, CoE) 
   If this holds there is nothing that experiences something
2) There is no SoE (S, $\lnot$SoE, CoE) 
   If this were true the Subject wouldn't be able to experience 
3) There is no CoE (S, SoE, $\lnot$CoE) 
   If this were true no content that the subject can experience exists
   Note: 
	   A subject knowing that it experiences nothing would still mean that it is aware of the fact that it experiences "Nothing" meaning this would translate to (S, SoE, "Nothing") 
	   where
	   Nothing $\neq\lnot$CoE. 
	   Because "Nothing" as concept is something that can be experienced.
	   Therefore $\lnot$CoE means there is structurally no content at all.
