# Breath field — spiral recursion (global integrator)
## Claim (formal)
The breath field is a global integration layer organizing validation cycles across the system, coordinating RTV, SRL, and audits.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
There is a system‑level “breathing” that coordinates all the local checking.

## Philosophical Justification
Breath mediates a balance between conservative (self‑stabilizing) and dynamic (expansive) tendencies. If only conservation operated, trajectories would collapse into perfect circles (no meaningful change); if only expansion operated, paths would fly off linearly (loss of context). Spiral recursion is the middle way: each cycle stays near prior arms, preserving contextual adjacency while progressing. Integrating validation across these cycles turns local checks into a global rhythm that sustains identity through change.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Spiral adjacency (nearby arms) supplies the “map” continuity needed for LocalReach; extremes degrade into triviality (circle) or drift (line).
