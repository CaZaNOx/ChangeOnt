> **Blurriness(x) :=**  
> A property of an Experience E(MoE(x), CoE(y)), representing the degree to which the truth or actuality of a particular aspect of CoE(y) is _spread over multiple possible candidates or alternatives_, rather than being sharply focused on a single, definite content.
> - **High blurriness:** Many possible alternatives for CoE(y) remain plausible (i.e., the subject’s experience is distributed or “smeared” across options, with no single one being certain).
> - **Low blurriness:** Experience is sharply focused on a single option; only one CoE(y) is considered true or actual for this experience.
>
> Formally we say
> Let Y$_i$ be the set of possible alternatives for a particular CoE(y) that also includes y.
> - **Blurriness(E(x,y)) =** The _probability distribution_ over Y$_i$ as assigned by the subject’s SoE(x).
>     - If all weight is on one y$_i\in$Y$_i$, blurriness is zero (maximal focus).
>     - If weight is spread, blurriness is high (maximal blur).
