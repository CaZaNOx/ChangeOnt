# Hypothesis — Worked example: σ(ε) and Σ in a simple dynamical system
Proposal
- Choose a toy evolving system; compute σ(ε) via detection variability and Σ via normalized distribution; show how Δ‑field inequality predicts persistence/collapse.

Test sketch
- Define signals, thresholds, perturbations; log locks, SE, Σ; compare predicted vs observed persistence.
