# Assumption — introduce definitions only when logically minimal and forced
## Content
Definitions (DF) are added only when prior commitments force them and their meaning is unambiguous under the current theory state.

## Rationale
Implements the bootstrapping constraint: avoid importing unearned primitives.

## Linkage
See [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-bootstrapping-constraint]].
