### Before any content comparison, you need to be aware:
[L61-L65] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L62: - AI_11 is an order of magnitude longer, so any comparison will be _skewed_ by length unless you specify a targeted comparison (e.g., "compare introduction style," "compare contradiction handling," "compare pointer use").
- L63: - Reading both files line by line and comparing for structure, recursion, drift, or contradiction is computationally expensive.

#### Options for comparison:
[L66-L79] labels=0 flags=4 paragraphs=8
- L69: 2.
- L71: 3.
- L78: Or do you want a critical, line-by-line contradiction and simulation drift scan across both files (will be slow and only return results if faults/fractures are found)?
- L79: Specify now, or I will default to structural recursion and drift/contradiction audit of the opening sections.

### What is possible and what is not:
[L98-L105] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=1
- L100: - I can only process both in chunked, recursive passes: Read N lines from each, compare for structural and conceptual overlaps, then surface only genuine points of connection or contradiction.

### 2. Recursion is more talked about than enacted:
[L143-L148] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0

- L177: i am curious about gödel holes topic

###### [AI]
[L178-L180] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1
- L179: Critical read on "Gödel holes" as a topic in the context of AI_12 (and your broader ontology project):

### 1. What are "Gödel holes"?
[L181-L186] labels=0 flags=3 paragraphs=0
- L182: - In your ontology and recursive chats, "Gödel holes" refers to:
- L183: - Structural points where a system is forced to reference something it cannot prove or contain within itself--akin to Gödel's incompleteness theorem in formal logic.
- L185: - In recursive or change-based ontologies, a Gödel hole signals a boundary: a step or motif that cannot be grounded from within the current chain, but is necessary for the system's ongoing self-coherence or expansion.

### 2. How does AI_12 handle or reference Gödel holes?
[L187-L192] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### 3. Is the treatment critical and sufficient?
[L193-L198] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L196: - It does not, for example, log the precise location or type of Gödel hole encountered; nor does it structurally modify its reasoning to survive the "hole."
- L197: - The drift is toward meta-awareness ("I might be simulating or skipping a foundational step"), but the protocol for handling a Gödel hole (collapse, pointer mark, or external justification) is not always applied.

### 4. How should Gödel holes be handled (critically, per your project)?
[L199-L205] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L201: - Every time a reasoning chain references something not internally grounded, it must log a "Gödel hole" (a gap, undecidable step, or external pointer).

### Summary Table
[L206-L212] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### Conclusion
[L213-L219] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=2
- L214: - Gödel holes are present as an anxiety and motif in AI_12, but are not systematically audited or structurally marked.
- L218: If you want to formalize "Gödel hole" treatment in your ledger or chain, I can provide a template for tracking, marking, and collapsing at such steps.

- L221: the point of curiosity i have is the following in 11 the agent told me all i developed is mapable to a makrov model but i think its missing the picture a bit becauae the development of the theory is not finalized and i wondered and if gödel holes could be one such indicator generally speaking i havent fully developed the ontology so i still lack the spelled out mechanisms that actually encode it.

###### [AI]
[L222-L224] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=1

### 1. You're Right to Resist the "Markov Model" Mapping
[L225-L231] labels=0 flags=3 paragraphs=0
- L226: - AI_11's claim that your framework "is just a Markov model" is both reductionist and (structurally) false--if your ontology's "space" (the subject-field itself) is changing as part of the model, not just _within_ a fixed background.
- L227: - Markov models assume a fixed state space and well-defined transitions:
- L229: - Even "hidden" Markov models have a fixed parameterization.

### 2. The "Gödel hole" as a Structural Boundary of Detection
[L232-L242] labels=0 flags=4 paragraphs=0
- L234: - A "Gödel hole" is not just a proof gap but a structural pointer to the limits of the system's own detection, encoding, or intelligibility.
- L235: - In your ontology, a Gödel hole could be:
- L239: - This aligns with Gödel's original insight:
- L241: - In your context: "Change is always happening, but the _how_ is sometimes outside of the current model's representational closure--this is the Gödel hole."

### 3. How this Differs from Markovian Closure
[L243-L246] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L244: - In a Markov model, the "unknown" is just a hidden state or noise; the structure of possibility is closed (finite or infinite, but static).

### 4. Where the Operator/Mechanism Problem Emerges
[L247-L254] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L252: - Ordinary transition operators (Markov, dynamical systems, even quantum) act _within_ a fixed space.

### 5. What to Do with "Gödel holes" in This Project
[L255-L262] labels=0 flags=3 paragraphs=0
- L256: - Critically, Gödel holes should be tracked, not erased:
- L257: - Whenever you encounter a necessary but unrepresentable link or factor in your derivations, mark it as a "Gödel hole"--a reference to an outside or undeclared dimension of change.
- L261: - Develop a way to encode (or at least reference) "frame changes" and keep Gödel holes visible as sites of recursive tension.

### Summary Table
[L263-L270] labels=0 flags=3 paragraphs=0
- L266: |State space fixed?|Yes|No (subject/space changes)|Markov mapping is inadequate|
- L268: |Gödel hole as undetectable link?|No|Yes--boundary of detection/closure|Should be logged as pointer|
- L269: |Is the "how" always intelligible?|Yes (in model)|No (outside, blind spots present)|Gödel holes show limits|

### What to do next?
[L271-L277] labels=0 flags=4 paragraphs=2
- L272: - Formally define the Gödel hole pointer/tag in your ontology: "A reference to a change, connection, or operator that cannot (yet) be represented within the current space/subject structure."
- L274: - Do not accept "Markov closure" as the final mapping unless your system can encode and transform its own space.
- L276: If you want help drafting a Gödel hole tracking protocol, or want to brainstorm meta-operators for space/subject transformation, say so.
- L277: If you want the AI to challenge its own closure at every step and log Gödel holes in future outputs, instruct it explicitly.

## Your Ontology of Change -- Core Features (as learned so far):
[L353-L379] labels=0 flags=9 paragraphs=8
- L362: - True reasoning must audit its own pointer chain--collapse or drift occurs if recursion is not maintained.
- L363: - Pointer failure, collapse, and Gödel holes are not bugs but structural features--sites of tension, open recursion, or undecidable difference.
- L365: - Unlike classical models (Markov, dynamical systems, standard physics), the configuration space itself is subject to change.
- L369: - Collapse (structural, recursive) is the recognition of pointer failure, the end of a chain, or a jump outside the current space (Gödel hole).
- L370: 6.
- L371: - The ontology enforces, or attempts to enforce, continual self-audit to avoid simulation, drift, or "fluent but empty" reasoning.
- L373: 7.
- L374: - Whenever a derivation requires an assumption, pointer, or cause not present in the current chain, it must be marked as a "Gödel hole" (gap, undecidable, or open pointer).
- L378: - All ontology, logic, and "science of experience" is itself subject to recursive drift, collapse, or undecidability.

## Critical Gaps / Unfinished Parts:
[L380-L384] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L383: - Transmission is at risk whenever drift, simulation, or "fluent reasoning" outpaces the pointer/collapse audit protocol.

## What I do not know (honestly):
[L385-L392] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=3
- L388: - Any "closure" of the ontology--by design, it is open to new structure, Gödel holes, and recursive extension.
- L390: If you want me to map your ontology to a formal system, or to critique its current closure and drift points, specify.

We will attempt to rigorously show that change serves as a productive framework with the capability to rival classical ontologies. We will in a first stage establish that change is always undeniably present for everyone and then use a doubting subject to ensure that we engage in maximum rigor. At this point it's worth mentioning that since we start from minimal assumptions the following is the case. We have to use preexisting concepts like logic, existence, language etc. to even be able to communicate. The attempt is that we will use common sense meanings until we get to a stage where we were able to derive the concepts from change ontology. Once done we will revisit the concepts used. Therefore concepts will be revisited and refined during the following reasoning chain. We will attempt to arrive first at core derivations to have a minimal set of derivations we can build upon. ## 0.1 performative Contradiction ![[Introduction - Performative Contradiction]] We define: ![[DF 0.1_1.#DF 0.1_1]] ## 0.2 You are reading this You the reader are reading this text currently. This is taken as undeniable fact of the matter. If you wouldn't exist or couldn't read you wouldn't know what I express in this text. Crucially you are reading this words now. We can therefore say: ![[FT 0.2_1.]] ![[CF 0.2_1.]] The reading and the now part are not performative contradictions since you could have heard about this statement by someone else in the past. Therefore [[FT 0.2_1.]] needs to be reformulated in a more general way to make it truly foundational. We can say: ![[FT 0.2_1-R.]] The statement [[CF 0.2_1.]] still holds but we can now state additionally ![[CF 0.2_2.]] We can now Summarize that No one can deny without PC that they aren't aware of the statement in the moment they negate it. ![[SUM 0.2_1.]] ## 0.3 Experience, awareness and the Subject We already established that you are aware of something as established in [[SUM 0.2_1.]]. However we lack proper definitions to talk about this insight. To gain more clarity we should define what *you*, *awareness* and *this something* is. *You* are a subject. For this statement to make sense we have to sketch out the term subject a bit more. We can say that a subject is something that has experience. This is valid because if something didn't have experience we in common sense parlance wouldn't call it a subject. It would just be an object like any other object. We say: ![[DF 0.3_1.#DF 0.3_1]] Further we can say that a subject is aware of whatever it experiences. For awareness to make sense it is necessary that there is a subject that is aware and that there is something it is aware of. If no subject was around awareness couldn't be around either it would just be a matter of fact that something is the case without anything being aware thereof. We say ![[DF 0.3_2.#DF 0.3_2]] If there is nothing the subject can be aware of there is nothing that can be experienced. Experience usually refers to a subject feeling/sensing/experiencing *something* which logically necessitates that there is *something* a subject can become aware of. We can define ![[DF 0.3_3.#DF 0.3_3]] The terms "subject," "awareness," and "experience" are not independently reducible by reflective analysis at this stage. Each only acquires its sense in immediate, lived reference to the others. Their meaning is not discovered by logical decomposition, but by the impossibility of denying that "I, as reader, am aware of experience." Any attempt to define one term in isolation, or to analyze their relation through imported metaphysics, risks tautology or under expressing what is taking place. Those 3 definitions seem circular but they aren't because they try to express the same concept in different ways and neither of the Definitions can be understood as preceding the others. This 3 Definitions should therefore be understood as different expressions of the same concept. - A subject requires that it becomes aware of experiences(s). If there is only a "subject" but it has no awareness or no experience we are not speaking of what is classically understood as a "subject". There would be no difference between an inanimate object we can therefore state ![[CF 0.3_1.]] - Awareness requires a subject experiencing something. If there where "awareness" without a subject experiencing it or without something that can be experienced the term "awarness" would be an empty term no in accordance with what is normally understood when we speak of awarness. Therfore we state: ![[CF 0.3_2.]] - Experience requires a subject becoming aware of said experience(s). If there was "expierience of something" without a subject being aware of whatever phenomena takes place said phenomena would just be an unexpierienced phenomena. The term expierience only makes sense if there is a subject having the expierience and being aware of it we therefore say: ![[CF 0.3_3.]] As point of clarification we say that a subject is experiencing something in the moment where it is a subject. If the subject currently doesn't have any experience it's not a subject anymore in the sense that it doesn't experience now. This can be made clearer by pointing out that we wouldn't say of dead people that they are still experiencing something or similarly we wouldn't state of potential future subjects that they are already experiencing. We say they were or will be subjects(with experience). To further clarify we should also state that experiencing and awareness is deliberately kept vague regarding consciousness. This is done because there might be edgecases like someone being unconscious for a brief moment or someone being in a state of reduced consciousness like a coma were we don't yet want to equate unconsciousness with not having experience. Meaning that awareness does not refer to concious awareness and rather to a more primitive notion where at least hypothetically a subject can have experiences without being conciously aware of them since they could still (maybe subconciously) be noticing experience. We therefore don't delve into consciousness as a topic for now. With this reflections we can now formulate: ![[CR 0.3_4.]] ![[CR 0.3_5.]] ![[CR 0.3_6. (CR 0.1)]] ![[SUM 0.3_1.]] ## 0.4 Reflecting on experience Reflecting or introspection of experience is inherently a subjective endeavor. Since only subjects have the ability to reflect and introspect their experience. ### Introspection Especially the content of introspection is subjective in nature. Meaning that it would be epistemically dishonest to claim global validity of what was revealed by the introspection. None the less I think its valuable to at least share what I recognize when introspecting. To increase the value of this introspection the reader should introspect on their own about the nature of their experience before proceeding further to prevent my introspection biasing the insights they have. This should be done now. Regarding my introspection I can't for the best of me understand, no matter how hard I try, specific experiences as a single moments in time. There's always the sensation of it happening and it's never just happening. Every experience I have always entails it arising and then fading or changing into something different no matter how hard I try to isolate it. I can't Experience anything as one static discrete point in time even if the introspected experience is abrupt. As stated this content of experience and it's introspection can't itself be formulized as a truth but it provides intuition regarding how we try to understand experience. Further it is worth pointing out that the how experiencing feels and behaves still is the core starting point of this project that gives it the depth we will try to explore. The Subjects experience should never be understood as just a flat term without content. It is the most epistemically true fact a subject has access to even if we couldn't reason or think about the world there would still be a wealth and depth of lived experience. If there is a subject there is always the depth of experiencing present. It therefore is essential that you as the reader take time to acknowledge and become aware of the fact that experience here doesn't just refer or function as a different word and rather as the core fact that makes you alive and provides meaning and depth to everything you encounter. In a sense it's the most epistemically true in a non negatable way. Not in a content sense but as a fact of the matter that experience is happening now and we can't argue against it. We will try to develop this notion more in later sections. ### Reflection Until then we want to reflect on experience. Unlike the introspections the reflections should provide us with insights that we can formulate in the same way we did above given the fact that the reader is aware of what is actually meant when we talk about experience as established in [[SUM 0.3_1.]] We already hinted at the fact that there seems to be structure in experience by pointing to the fact that the definitions in section 3 describe the same core concept. Lets now reflect on this via an example. If we think of any finite object in 3d space we can say or define that a object(for example a coin) has a frontside and a back side or a top and a bottom. But we understand that if we look at the top of the coin we don't see the bottom of said coin. However we for the concept of the coin still understand that the coin as object structurally entails that a coin has a top and a bottom. We could therefore define a relata "other sidedness" that states if an object has a topside it structurally implies that it also has a bottom side. Analogously we can state that if there is a subject it structurally via relata awareness implies that experiences are being had. These relata shouldn't be understood as functions or processes that takes place. Instead we should understand them as conceptual tools to highlight the structural facts of the concepts they describe. It would be wrong to think that the coins topside produces the bottomside of the coin so to speak. Instead it's more accurate to conceptualize it as a structurally mandatory for the coin to always have a top and a bottom side. And us using a relata to express the structural fact that when we look at the top we don't see the bottom and vice versa is only there to make the structural nature of the coin intelligible. The same can be applied to our definition triplet the subject could be top and the experience could be the bottom so to speak and the awareness of expresses the structural fact that one logically implies the other. While this analogy is simplistic in nature we can still draw from it. We can derrive that "becoming aware" should not trivally be understood as process that makes expierience happen or as something that necessary enforces the structure or determines it and rather as a term that expresses the structural reality that subjects experience. There is not necessary a process that via causality creates one definition from the other. Further the coin example also hints at a different insight. While we can reasonably say a coin has a top and bottom this is actually a specific way of expressing a more basic fact that already presupposes that we know where up and down is in our 3d space is. But we can more generally express that a side has a logical other side that is not visible or behaves a certain way. Similarly we can conceptualize consciousness that is understood via the relata awareness might be a to specific notion of a more general structural relationship. This doesn't mean that consciousness as concept is not the most reasonable way to understand experience from our human perspective. It only expresses that there might be more basic structural properties of the experiencing subject that don't necessarily translate trivially to our notion of consciousness. This means that we can conceptualize consciousness as understood via awareness as its used in common understanding of consciousness could function like the terms top and bottom for the coin in the sense that saying a coin has a top and bottom might still be the most reasonable way to speak about the coin. But is to stong of a formulation as such. And that there is a more fundamental notion of opposit side that is not as demanding(doesn't require us to know where up and down is). So it makes sense to relax the term awarenss to not be the equivalent of top-bottom(consciousness) and instead expressing only the structural statement "otherSideExists"(proto consciousness or experiencing without full classical consciousness). Furthermore we should highlight at this point that the top-bottom analogy is not entirely valid for the subject having experience relationship due to the fact that top-bottom structurally excludes one from the other (either we see the top or the bottom). While awareness as a term functionaly speaking joins the two terms subject and Experience. So it makes sense to at this point view the relata awareness like the relata isCoin. where isCoin joins top and bottom together and logically already includes the fact of unified object with structural fact that opposite Sides exist entailed in it and having opposit sides not being a process that creates two sides and rather being structurally speaking a fact of the matter that is always the case wherever there is a coin. Translating the insights of the analogy to our case of a combined concept of a subject being aware of expierience we can say that the terms subject, awarenes of, and experience are not necessarily creating each other. And rather being a structural analysis where a subject having experiences in at least a proto concious sense is a fact of the matter and each of the terms if reflected deeply enough already entails the notion of the joined experiencingSubject that could be aware of this by expieriencing things in a combined way. We therefore define: ![[DF 0.4_1. (DF 0.7)#DF 0.4_1]] While we still need to continue using all three terms to properly analyze this unified concept to maintain intelligibility it should be understood that each of the terms always expresses the combined fact of experiencingSubject where awareness doesn't necessitates consciousness as we know it. And crucially that the current moment of awareness of experience is taking place now. where taking place now is for a specific experience also a fact of the matter for the experiencingSubject since what is experienced is bound to a specific happening. Lets now reflect on the difference between having experience as structural ability to be aware of something and specific experiences that take place and have content. The ability of a subject to have different experiences implies that there is a stable structure that allows experience to take place. Logically speaking we can say that if the abstract capability of experiencing content wouldnt exist a subject wouldnt be able to experience specific content. However this capability is not causing or allowing experiences to happen and rather a fact of the matter when a specific experience takes place. We find us in the same situation like with the coin where we use different terms to express a structural property of a subject having experiences that is always the case when an experiencingSubject is present. We define: ![[DF 0.4_2. (DF 0.8)#DF 0.4_2]] Given the definition of SoE we can understand that the capability of being aware or having expieriences can be unerstood as structural expressions of the subjects ability to expierience specific content now. Therefore those terms can be understood as expressing SoE It is worth noting that this reflections arent logical derivations in a strict sense and rather insights about the terms we use and what their definitions entail. It was already shown by prior reflections of the terms we defined that they logically require each other like top requires bottom and where already in a sense present when we defined a subject as something that is aware of its current experience and when You read the word "You" in FT 0.1 the word you like the word CoinTopSide already included that there is a coin and a bottom out of the structural nature of what the word describes. However what this reflection allows us to do is expand the definitions of experience to make experiencingSubject more intelligble, disiectable and analyzable in the future. The prior reflections allow us to establish or define that there is a structure inherit in the being an experiencingSubject or more pointed in awareness of experience. Where the structure is that which actually binds the definitions together and makes a subject without experience or awareness thereof a factual impossibility like a coin with only a top side is a factual impossibility. Further with the differentiation of expieriencing as a capability and specific experiences as that which happens we can say that specific experiences have content that for now isn't restricted in any way. We can say that we can experience pain, joy, statements, seeing an object or its colors ect. where we don't for now dont investigate further what is experienced and just note down the fact that there is content of Expierience that a subject is aware of/expieriencing. we therefore define ![[DF 0.4_3. (DF 0.9)#DF 0.4_3]] Lets also briefly reflect on my introspection. While my introspection hints at a becoming of experience we don't yet have sufficient grounds to properly ground this. So we for now will not use this introspection and no longer speak of becoming aware of experience and rather use being aware of experience as more general but flatter understanding of experience. The reason for this is that being aware of still allows us to speak of experiences as single happenings while becoming would already enforce that experiencing is not a single point and rather a unfolding of change. However it should be mentioned at this point that we already have at least in theory grounds to assume that becoming aware of experience might be more appropriate after all hinted at by the fact that experience is often being reported as seemingly continuous stream. But at least for now didn't sufficiently establish and reflect on change and if it is fundamentally structurally entailed in experiencing. This will be done later for now we understand experience as only being not becoming. ![[SUM 0.4_1. (Sum 0.6)]] ## 0.5 Doubting ![[DF 0.5_1. (DF 0.10)#DF 0.5_1]] Lets tackle the topic of doubting. First we should clarify that doubting is not the same as negating. If we have a jar of sand before us and someone states "There are exactly 5 million corns of sand in this jar" we can doubt this statement. This doesn't mean that the statement is necessary is wrong. It could be but it also could be correct. All that doubting expresses is that we are not convince of the statement. If i did a good job until now I managed to minimize doubt. But legitimate doubt still persists. We are using language that at least for now seems to presuppose time, memory and other capabilities. We didn't yet meet the level of rigor required for the reader to be without relevant doubt. Generally speaking you at least have the capability to doubt. So we state ![[FT 0.5_1. (FT 0.4)]] ![[CF 0.5_1. (CF 0.11)]] If subjects can doubt it means that the subject has the experience of doubting. There is a experienced difference between not doubting a statement(believing a statement) and disbelieving a statement. ![[CR 0.5_1. (CR 0.6)]] With this insights in mind we can now reflect on doubting. It should be clear that we can doubt CoE. If we consider Descartes meditations we more clearly see that in theory any CoE can be doubted. We could always be dreaming, mislead by our imperfect senses or have illusions. More modern formulations would maybe use the us being in a simulation analogy. So even if we are certain of CoS we can always apply doubt. Even in relation to our ability to think logically or formulate true statements. So in a sense everything above can at least in principal be doubted in the sense that they are expressions of thought put into language. Descartes already did this for us and reasonably arrived at the statement cogito ergo sum - I think therefore I am. But in a sense we can make this formulation even more strict. Descartes also doubted the ability to derive logical conclusions. So in a sense the ergo is not valid since it is a logical conclusion. To be more strict we should reformulate it to I think, I am. But even thinking as specific action is in a sense importing to much. More strictly we could state "I experience". As the deepest point of doubt we can reach where the concept of doubting breaks down. There is nothing left to doubt about having experience or being some I with that experience. We hit epistemic bedrock. Both the I and the experience if understood as just a experiencingSubject as defined above can not be doubted without leading to complete emptiness that is structurally negates the validity of doubt. To make this more apparent it's worth clarifying that at this level of doubt the experience has no understandable content anymore and the subject is barely more then a abstract expression of experience being had. We are no longer talking of a human with thoughts feelings body or mind. Even doubt left and what is left is pure experiencing. At this point it's worth clarifying certain points. Some readers might agree but mistakenly not conceptualize this as ontology, they might argue that this is just a subjects thoughts or doubts and there is no bigger statement about ontology here. But nothing could be further from the truth. Ontology tries to derive or define core concepts of what is. But for one the ontological claims all already require experience as a meta condition. Any intellectual concept or theory serves the goal to make reality understandable to at least one subject. without this subject there would be no ontologies and no theory about reality. All those mental constructs serve to make the reality understandable but this doesn't only require or expresses a description of reality that might be more stable then a subject but also something reality becomes understandable to. All statements in any theory are build on the fact that something was experienced in a certain way. We are not performing a solipsistic exercise here either. We don't negate the possibility that the insights had via experience might be bigger then the experiencingSubject itself. We are trying to answer and explore what still holds when even the world we know is gone what is so fundamentally true of reality that it is expressed already in the most epistemically minimal and stable point we can reach. Further Descartes doubts are hypothetical. We don't actually claim that doubt could reach such a strength that it could actually negate content of experience. If you are in pain you can't doubt it. You just know that you are in pain. So the maximal doubt we want to engage with is very clearly a thought experiment it is at no point claimed that a real living being could actually reach this level of doubt. Third even when applying maximal doubt in the thought experiment we cant overcome the initial performative contradiction. If there is doubt there is always out of structurall necessetiy a subject that experiences the doubt. What would there be to doubt if there was no experience and no subject that actually doubts. We now define ![[DF 0.5_2. (DF 0.11)#DF 0.5_2]] The DS will serve as that which we use to strip all we assume to know or what we take for granted. A pure expression of experiencing of an experiencingSubject that has exactly that experience and nothing more. We saw that the DS no matter how hard it tries can't doubt its having a minimal structure. Its obvious at this point that the DS itself couldnt realize this itself and not express it. With only pure experience without thought or language it wouldn't be aware of their being structure. It would only be aware of experience without certain believe in its content. The DS itself however is a mute tool/thought experiment on it's own. So to actually build this theory we as capable subjects need to reason about and for tve DS and need to attempt to put ourselfs as good as possible into the shoes of the DS. Further it makes sense to introduce a relaxed version of the DS that is capable of folowing reasoning chains and approve or dissaprove of statements in some way while still trying to keep the doubt at a maximal level. One way to conceptualize this could be a toddler. It doesn't make sense to ask a todler about the temporal structure or sensation it had so to speak. But if we tune our questions and ask questions like did you experience something and assume it would understand this simple question and would nod we would have insights of something approaching more closely what a DS is while not completely reaching the DS as defined above. It is worth pointing out that a toddler would still undergo hypithetical doubt so while an actual toddler might know at least somehow what it eypieriences a Doubting todler or Relaxed doubting subject would still be unable to formulate anything about the content of experience (what is saw, how it felty what it sensed or perceived) and would only be able to give answers relating to the struvture of experiencing not content. we define [[DF 0.5_3. (DF 0.12)]] Relaxed Doubting Subject (RDS):= Doubting subject able to perform basic thought and give answers for questions about structure of experience. One further clarification in relation to transparency of what will be done needs to be provided. Namely we assume that if the RDS was able to logically follow or provkde answers to our questions that allow us derive certain things we evolve the DS or RDS respectively. The reasonong behind this is that if we were a le to ground some structual truth with using epistemic bedrock we can assume that it actually holds and that therefore a DS would structurally at least in theory have the ability to realize the structure because it would be an unavoidable fact of the matter like the subject experiencing. In short if we gained a structural insight despite applying maximal doubt it is consitent and justifed to assume this derivation to hold and to make the DS and RDS aware of this insight aswell. This is required for us to build something from the overall figure of thought we are engaging in. It is strongly suggested that the reader at this point in time tries to put hinself in to the shoes of a DS or RDS to the best of his abilities. What does pure experience feel like after you applied maximal doubt and don't know of the content of your experience. Only focusing on the fact that you are experiencing without focusing on content that is perceived. Only that structural percieving is going on. ![[SUM 0.5_1. (Sum 0.7)]] ## 0.6 Becoming aware is change We can say now that you as reader at some point became aware of the statement [[FT 0.2_1-R.]] You weren't always aware of this statement there was a moment in time were you hadn't yet thought about the statement. So ![[FT 0.6_1.]] If we assume that sections 1-3 hold a negating of this statement would tackle becoming aware part. Meaning we would negate that you weren't always aware of this specific statement. The positive formulation of this has multiple layers since it would imply. That you always had awareness of this specific statement in this text. Meaning you would say that even before you learned to read, understand language or have the capability for this level of genuine own reflection you would already been aware of this statement. This is a PC because it states that before you had the tools to reason and understand you already understood the statement that requires reasoning. Or it would imply that in the very first moment of your experience already knew of this statement expressed by me. Further you being aware of this statement now means you are experiencing this statement. Meaning even if you heard or read this statement prior the specific experience of knowing it in your inception would be the same as you now reading/hearing/thinking it again. Which would imply that there was no different experiences in between. All you ever knew and experienced would be this statement. ![[CF 0.6_1. (CF 0.8)]] ![[CR 0.6_1. (CR 0.2)]] ![[CR 0.6_2. (CR 0.3)]] If [[CR 0.6_2. (CR 0.3)]] wasn't the case this would mean that whatever two experiences we pick they would have no difference in content of experience, how the experience feels or when the experience took place. Meaning both experiences being exactly the same down zo the fact that they both happen now. This is in contradiction to [[CR 0.6_1. (CR 0.2)]], [[CF 0.6_1. (CF 0.8)]] and [[CF 0.6_2 (CF 0.9)]] ![[SUM 0.6_1. (Sum 0.3)]] ## 0.7 Change [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] Change:= We understand change as that which produces difference. Or in other words as something that makes difference occur. ![[FT 0.7_1. (FT 0.3)]] [[RF 0.7_1.]] The statement [[FT 0.7_1. (FT 0.3)]] can be translated with [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] to Production of difference, takes place. If there was nothing that makes something take place we end up with nothing happening. Crucially we wouldn't be able to notice different experiences because difference in Experience requires that there are two Experiences that can be compared. ![[CF 0.7_1. (CF 0.10)]] For [[CF 0.7_1. (CF 0.10)]] to hold we have to show that becoming/being aware means something happens. Being aware is the relata that links the subject with the content of it's experience if this linking wouldn't happen this would mean that a subject would be void of content or in other words not have experiences at all claiming this would mean [[SUM 0.6_1. (Sum 0.3)]] wouldn't hold. we can state ![[CR 0.7_1. (CR 0.4)]] Further we can state ![[CR 0.7_2. (CR 0.5)]] If we reflect further on change we can draw the following distinction. If change just happens randomly anything can happen at any point. This is distinct from change being structured. Where certain change leads to other change in a structured way. We for now can not state that change necessarily globally obeys being structured. However we as subjects know that the change or difference we experience has structure. Since it is predicable to a certain degree and there are structures like the subject are present and that they persist over time. So the amount of predictions we can make indicates that at least for what we observe change isn't just random happening. The structure of change will be investigated in more detail and with more rigor in later sections. We therefore refrain from making clear statements for now however it's worth pointing out that the subject being aware of experiences and having experiences over time influences our conceptualization of at least local changes we observe and can predict with a certain level of accuracy. ![[SUM 0.7_1. (Sum 0.5)]] ## 0.8 Intermediate summary What did we do until now? We attempted to at least in a semi rigorous fashion explore core concepts from a everyday (human) subjects experience. For this we utilized concepts like temporality that itself were not rigorously explored and rather used as in a common sense kind of way. So in a sense we established very obvious insights like there exists a reader of this text that has experiences that where not always the case and that notices difference and change in their everyday life. This user is also capable of doubt. If this is all that was attempted why did we even go trough the effort and painstaking slow way of formulating this? The reason is simple this serves to a establish a basic reasingn chain that starts from where everyday humans are at and to ground and define certain concepts so we can use or revisit them later down the line. So what we did is use basic human intuiton to build drafts of concepts and establish draft definitions that will serve to progress reasonably in the following more rigorous sections. Further it was also used to create or fertilize the intuition pumpt that is needed or usefull to grasp what is happening and why in later sections. Its easier to gain a intuiton of experience if the content wasnt yet doubted/abstracted away or the concept of difference and change if its still an obious fact of life rather then an derived insight. Additionally it was done to limit the switching between the DS and the normal humans subject creating unnecessary confusion if all is put together. ## 0.9 Meta Reflections After having briefly summarized we can perform some meta reflections. First of all it should be mentioned that this structure was chosen by me to immediately onboard you the reader not as passive participant but active starting point of this journey we are on. You the reader are not just a reader you are the subject we talked of it's your experience your inisghts, your potential reasoning and reflections we explore not mine. You're maximal doubt is what leads to the DS and is what motivates the RDS. Afterall you could be an idealist and I could just be an illusion of your mind without experience my self. I am in that sense soley trying to express reflections and statements you can truely articulate making you aware of a deeper foundational truths that where always there and just needed to be explored. Afterall you are the only thing remaining after you performed maximal doubt to the best of your abilities. What we are trying to do here is not fit and tune some theory of someone to reality and reather explore what is fubdamentally true for you. To conceptualize what we are doing the analogy of a ship on high seas is usefull. The ship stands for your current knowledge, thoughts, experiences, tools for reasoning like logic that has served you well in the past and therefore can be justifiably be used. However what we are trying to do is to theoretically replace the planks of static ontology with new planks of change first ontology to see if the result of this excerise leads to a better more capable ship. But we can't replace all planks simultaneously and just throw everything out at once. Then you would be left without a ship on the ocean of reality. So we want to methodically replace one plank after the other slowly renovating the ship. This means that ideally later on we are able to replace higher level concepts and tools. Obvious examples of this are stability of entities, time or logic. Where we for now utilize logic that has proven itself to be a valuable tool to derive insights until change ontology reached a stage where it can itself define logic that superseeds the existing logic. This is a valuable point to reflect on because if change ontology fails in doing so sufficiently it failed. However this process is not as straightforward and requires potentially revisiting concepts derived by change ontology multiple times before they pass the requirement formulated here. Making this a recursive process where the first recursion was defining and elaborating on the concepts as we did in prior sections. This is itself in accordance with change ontology itself. Because if change is actually the ontological primary it needs to hold, apply to and explain all areas of reality. If it was only locally true it wouldnt meat its ontolgical requirements. Further it also is what we would expect from a change ontology where concepts are not just postulated axiomatic truths and rather derived concepts that need to be revisited again and again to make them more stable, refined and emerging from the ontological primary itself. In that sense the messy nature of the above sections is expected because we try to bridge from you existence fbased ontology to a change ontology and need to work with what we have. ## 0.10 Bigger picture and Sketches To frutifully an transparently transition in to the next layer we should quickly and roughly draft the bigger picture of what we are trying to achieve and ground some intuitions so that when performed later on it's clear what is being done and why and we understand the "human level" motivation. In a sense we are trying to puzzle a new picture of reality and arraging the puzzle pieces in rigorus fashion might lead to readers getting lost in the process especially if they arent aware of what is to result from it. The intuitions and bigger picture here however should at no point serve as justifcations of the following rigorous reasoning chain. The reasoning chain has to ultimately hold on its own and also be without gaps and work without what is expressed in this section. So its important that even if intuitively clear the reader maintains a maximal level of criticallity for the further reasoning steps. So what is the bigger picture? What we are doing is the following. We take the subjective experience as epistemically undoubtable data point of reality that entails structure by its very nature and apply maximum doubt possible to maintain epistemic rigor. In a first step we want to show that change is the underlying driver of experience. This will be done by pointing to the fact that experience via concept of change points over/outside of itself. Establishing change as more fundamental then even experience itself. This will be done by pointing to the fact that this experience wasn't always the case. In a next step we use logical arguments to analyze change itself and from this arrive at the fact that change always was the case and is continuous. With change established as more fundamental we can derive that the subject is a local area of change and we know that this local area has structure. The local area we speak of is the space of intelligibility of the subject. We do this to formulate a topology and later on metrics of change as understood by this text. That serve to ground stable concepts as arising out of change itself. In a next layer we develop dynamics that govern the topology. In a next step we try to derive Logic, and recursive structures and then in a further layer derive probability semantic fields and intersubjectivity. If this can be done sufficiently in a rigorous fashion this allows us to formulate alternative change based models that we then can use to construct toy models and compare their prediction accuracy in comparison of current not change ontology based scientific models and see how the different models perform. These toy models would be defined for multiple domains not just a specific one to show the globality of the claim. We can later on also start developing advanced changed based concepts and theory drafts where that change ontology could explore in the future. In the next sections we start deep diving in to the world of rigorous derivation from change using the experience data point where we strip classical notions like temporality, memory, CoE etc. using the DS in general this derivations should hold for a DS or RDS that is used to investigate and derive without gap and maximum rigor. Before we do that it makes sense to quickly draft the two arguments about change while still using the normal human lens to gain intuition for it. Change was always the case Argument. The argument structure is surprisingly simple and works via proof by contradiction The argument goes as follows: p1 change is happening now p2 Change stopped completely at a random point in the past Cr1: if p2 is true it means that there was no change anymore in the past Cr2 if p1 is true it means that p2 had to change to something new to eventually lead to p1 Conclusion1 Cr2 is in contradiction with p2 therefore change could have never not be present in the past Conclusion2 change was always present in the any past moment Change is Continuous argument Proof by contradiction P1 There exists a minimal, discrete change p2: The minimal discrete step itself has a beginning (just occurred) and a "being closer to transitioning the when it just happened" Contradiction: If p1 expresses a minimal size the can be no further smaller sized differentiation of it that changes from one to another Conclusion: change is continuous a different way to conceptualize this is understanding change as a continuous arrow pointing from the past e.g. Last year to last week to now if at any point this arrow is interrupted/has a gap (no change) no matter how small there is a point where there is no change anymore that contradicts the current observation of change and leads to the necessity of something leading to change even if all change was presumably gone. One further intuition we can derive from the arrow is that the points in time we picked out are not inherently different from any other points and rather selections by the subject to illustrate/grasp difference well. Meaning that the subject is bound by being capable to observe a local minimal change while change itself has no minimum and that the points/states picked by it are what we conceptualize as objects or states that serve to illustrate change. I am aware that the argument as layed out here is not rigorous and uses loaded concepts like time. But again this serves only to give an intuition for when we rigourously derive it structurally without requiring temporality. # 1 Doubting Subject Derivations Let's now starting with rigorously deriving change first ontology. In the prior section we formulated intuitive Definitions and insights to have basic terminology and concepts we can utilize to ground a more rigorous approach. ## 1.1 Restating insights of section 0 To have a proper grounding we revisit and revise definitions where reasonable. We leave as is: ![[DF 0.1_1.#DF 0.1_1]] ![[FT 0.2_1-R.]] ![[DF 0.3_1.#DF 0.3_1]] But we update [[DF 0.3_1.]] ![[DF 1.1_1.]] ![[DF 0.3_2.#DF 0.3_2]] We also reformulate [[DF 0.3_2.]] to focus on the structural aspects ![[DF 1.1_2.]] ![[DF 0.3_3.#DF 0.3_3]] We revise [[DF 0.3_3.]] to ![[DF 1.1_3.]] ![[DF 0.4_1. (DF 0.7)#DF 0.4_1]] we similarly revise [[DF 0.4_1. (DF 0.7)]] like this ![[DF 1.1_4.]] ![[DF 0.4_2. (DF 0.8)#DF 0.4_2]] becomes ![[DF 1.1_5.]] and ![[DF 0.4_3. (DF 0.9)#DF 0.4_3]] becomes ![[DF 1.1_6.]] For now we keep as is the following Definitions ![[DF 0.5_1. (DF 0.10)#DF 0.5_1]] ![[DF 0.5_2. (DF 0.11)#DF 0.5_2]] ![[DF 0.5_3. (DF 0.12)]] If you as a the subject would perform maximal doubt and reach a level of Doubt Approximating you being a DS we can adjust [[FT 0.6_1.]] from ![[FT 0.6_1.]] to ![[FT 1.1_1.]] We for now don't touch the two insights below since they are for now under expressed [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] Change:= That what happens. ![[FT 0.7_1. (FT 0.3)]] ## 1.2 Building the Framework We want to now ground everything we can properly with the reflections of chapter 0 and the revisited definitions as our fundament. We defined the ES in the prior section. With all the insights we gathered it is reasonable to properly highlight the point that the ES is the foundational concept that expresses what being a subject in the world means that is concept on which the following insights are build and that the concepts subject, SoE and CoE are only utilized to make this foundational concept intelligible. We therefore update [[DF 1.1_4.]] to: [[DF 1.2_1.]] > ExperiencingSubject (ES) := The truly foundational unified concept of a subject experiencing something that is the most epistemically true fact of any experience. With our initial reflections we established that there is at least one ES understood as subject (the thing) experiencing(being aware of) something(this statement). We say [[FT 1.2_1.]] > From [[DF 1.1_4.]] and [[FT 0.6_1.]] > There exists an experiencingSubject (ES) > $\exists$ ES We reflected on the fact that the ES is the object that entails a subject experiencing something. To properly grasp the ES and make it intelligible we define a structural 3-tuple for the ES that includes the subject, the structure and the content present in an ES. we define [[DF 1.2_2.]] > Based on [[FT 1.2_1.]] > ES-Tuple := (Subject, SoE, CoE) Any experience or statement can be translated to this tuple. There is always a subject (S) experiencing(SoE) content(CoE). [[CF 1.2_1.]] From [[FT 1.2_1.]] 1) There is no subject ($\lnot$S, SoE, CoE) If this were true nothing that experiences something would exist 2) There is no SoE (S, $\lnot$SoE, CoE) If this were true the Subject wouldn't be able to experience 3) There is no CoE (S, SoE, $\lnot$CoE) If this were true no content that the subject can experience exists Note: A subject knowing that it experiences nothing would still mean that it is aware of the fact that it experiences "Nothing" meaning this would translate to (S, SoE, "Nothing") where Nothing $\neq\lnot$CoE. Because "Nothing" as concept is something that can be experienced. We therefore clarify that $\lnot$CoE means there is structurally no content at all. We define and clarify the ES-tuple terms in relation to each other [[DF 1.2_3.]] > Based on [[DF 1.2_2.]] > Subject (S) := Position 1 in ES-Tuple. > - S is the abstract holder/site/reference frame/anchor/location wherein SoE and CoE can be specified. > - The subject provides a location that allows SoE and CoE to be present > - We say S is that which has SoE and CoE > - Without a subject there is no location for instantiation of experience. [[DF 1.2_4.]] >Based on [[DF 1.2_2.]] > Structure of Experience (SoE) := Position 2 in ES-Tuple > - SoE is the abstract organization, patterns or relations that govern the instantiation of CoE in S. > - SoE specifies how CoE is realized in S. > - We say SoE is that which shapes CoE of S > - Without SoE, CoE wouldn't be intelligible for S. [[DF 1.2_5.]] > Based on [[DF 1.2_2.]] > Content of Experience (CoE) := Position 3 in ES-Tuple > - Is the "thing" that is present or appearing in/to S. > - Content provides what is being structured by SoE and integrated into S. > - We say CoE is what appears to S governed by SoE > - Without CoE nothing that can be structured to appear to S is present. A useful Analogy is understanding the Subject as a screen of a Television, SoE as the rules or capabilities of the screen that govern what appears on the screen(resolution, color, timing, etc) and CoE is the images displayed. To make our language more capable we state that there are different ways a Subject can experience CoE. In the prior chapter we started with the Reader being aware of the statement in question by reading it. Later we reflected on the fact that the Subject could also just have heard of the statement, or could be doubting the statement. Since we established in [[CR 0.5_1. (CR 0.6)]] that a subject can doubt and that doubting is different from not doubting a statement. We can establish that [[FT 1.2_2.]] > From [[CR 0.5_1. (CR 0.6)]] > There exist different ways the same CoE can be experienced. We define that there are different Modes of Experience [[DF 1.2_6.]] > Based on [[FT 1.2_2.]] > Modes of Experience (MoE) := Different ways the same CoE can be experienced by the Subject based on difference in SoE. > We say: > MoE$\subseteq$SoE We state that [[CR 1.2_1.]] > From [[FT 1.2_2.]] and [[DF 1.2_6.]] > $\exists$ x,y: x$\neq$y where x$\in$MoE $\land$ y$\in$MoE > (There exist two different MoE x and y) from this it follows that a subject experiences the same content differently we define [[DF 1.2_7.]] > Based on [[CR 1.2_1.]] > Experience E(X,Y) := The specific combination of elements from SoE and CoE expressed as > $\exists$ X,Y: E(X,Y) where X$\subseteq$SoE and Y$\subseteq$CoE > We say Experience E(X,Y) consists of Structure (SoE) and Content (CoE) We state [[CR 1.2_2.]] > From [[CR 1.2_1.]] and [[DF 1.2_7.]] > $\exists$ Y: Y$\subseteq$CoE > (There is specific content Y) > $\exists$ X$_1$, X$_2$: X$_1$, X$_2\subseteq$SoE and X$_1\neq$ X$_2$ > (There are at least two possible Structures of Experience) > where > $\exists$ x$_1$, x$_2$: x$_1\neq$x$_2$ where x$_1\in$X$_1$ and x$_2\in$ X$_2\land$x$_2\notin$X$_1$ and x$_1$,x$_2\in$MoE > (The two possible structures differ in their Mode of Experience) > such that > E(X$_1$, Y) $\neq$ E(X$_2$, Y) > (Their are two Experiences with the same Content Y but different Modes of Experience) To be able to more easily communicate the concepts and not over complicate we need to clarify and relax the ES-Tuple. As it stands now the ES-Tuple can express any Subject having any SoE with any CoE. Since we want to differentiate general cases vs specific cases or sub cases we state the following [[CL 1.2_1.]] >For [[DF 1.2_2.]] >1) Anything in the relevant location of the Tuple is to be understood as what the position in the tuple signifies so ES-Tuple (x,y,z) means x is a Subject, y is a SoE and z is a CoE. >2) If there is specific topics pointed out or talked about like MoE we can write: (x, MoE, z) where MoE expresses any MoE$\subseteq$SoE > and (x, MoE(y),z) expresses a specific MoE called y. If not described differently it is assumed that the remaining structure required for experiencing is filled as general SoE. > This applies to any introduced concept relevant to the Tuple including S, SoE, CoE and any subsets thereof. We can therefore state (x,y,z) = (S(x), SoE(y), CoE(z)) >3) Any elements of the tuple (x,y,z) are never really understood as single elements. Instead we understand them as "reasonable sets". > The expression "reasonable sets" tries to express that in change ontology a classical single element doesn't exist trivially. So if we speak of MoE(y) where for example y="Thinking" we don't intend to express that thinking is some minimal element of MoE. Afterall it could be reasoned that thinking might or might not be a complex construct build out of other more fundamental elements of SoE. Similarly we don't want to express with using z="This statement" that "This statement" is some minimal content that couldn't in theory be broken up in to more fine grained CoE. Or for x=Subject that some minimal Subject property wise exists that stays exactly the same over different experiences With this Clarification in mind we can progress to making sense of Performative Contradiction (PC) using the ES-Tuple. Where PC can be understood as CoE negating the existence of S or SoE or relevant structures of SoE. [[DR 1.2_1.]] > From [[DF 1.2_2.]] and [[DF 0.1_1.]] > Given the following CoE we reason > If CoE(x) =: > 1) "I don't exist"="$\lnot$S(x)" > translates to a subject experiences CoE($\lnot$S(x)). > In other words > (S(x), SoE, CoE($\lnot$S(x))) > If CoE($\lnot$S(x)) where true it would mean that there is no S(x). > With [[DF 1.2_3.]] and [[CF 1.2_1.]] this means that CoE($\lnot$S(x)) would break the Tuple (PC) and it would make no sense to understand $\lnot$S(x) as something that can be a true CoE(x). > Similar examples hold for CoE(x) where x is negating ES, SoE, CoE or combinations thereof like E(x,y). > 2) A subject thinking "I am not thinking"="MoE($\lnot$thinking)" translates to (S, MoE(thinking), "MoE($\lnot$thinking)"). This doesn't break the tuple like in case 1. Instead it is a PC because structure of SoE relevant for the specific CoE(x) is negated. In this example the structure that allows thinking of statements is negated. If thinking wasn't structurally possible the statement could never be thought. This provides us with the insight that relevant SoE supersedes specific CoE making CoE(x) false. This two examples provide us with the following insights [[CR 1.2_3.]] > From [[DR 1.2_1.]] > 1) CoE is a PC if it > - breaks the tuple > - refutes relevant SoE. > 1) SoE superseeds CoE > 2) We can say certain CoE is false if it conflicts with insight 1) allowing us to structurally negate CoE options. We redefine Performative Contradiction in the context of the ES-Tuple as > [[DF 1.2_8.]] > Based on [[DF 0.1_1.]] > Structural Contradiction (SC) := CoE(x) that negates the structure of the ES-Tuple or CoE relevant structure of SoE > [[CR 1.2_3x.]] > From [[DF 1.2_8.]] and [[DF 0.1_1.]] > PC$\subseteq$ SC > holds because because PC limits the contradictions to a subject expressing a specific proposition that is in contradiction with the act performed by the subject. > While SC also holds even if the subject isn't expressing the condition specifically. It holds that any SC can be made a PC when the subject expresses it as proposition. > This relaxation of PC to SC allows us to formulate structurally true statements by negating the CoE(x) that would cause SC. This hold for any CoE(x) even if x is not causing a PC currently. > [[DF 1.2_9.]] > Based on [[DF 1.2_8.]] and [[CR 1.2_3x.]] > Structural Negation (SN) := Negation of CoE(x) that could produce a SC. it follows that >[[CR 1.2_4.]] from [[DF 1.2_8.]] and [[DF 1.2_9.]] >A subject can have structurally false CoE(x) [[CR 1.2_4x.]] From [[DF 1.2_8.]] [[DF 1.2_9.]] and [[CR 1.2_3x.]] Structurally Negating (SN) a CoE(x) that that could produce a SC allows us to derive Structural Facts [[DF 1.2_15.]] >From [[CR 1.2_4x.]] Structural Fact (SF) := We say something is a structural fact if a Subject structurally can't hold/doubt that an existing structure is present without engaging in a SC. In [[DF 0.5_1. (DF 0.10)]] we established that doubting is possible. To get clearer picture we define > [[DF 1.2_10.]] > believing(x) := Is a property of/function on Experience understood as degree to which a subject perceives a CoE(x) to be true for a specific MoE(x). > We say that for an Experience E(MoE(x),CoE(y)) the function/property believing(E) specifies how blurry a CoE(y) is in relation to the MoE(x) applied to generate this specific Experience E regarding the truthfulness of CoE(y). [[DF 1.2_10x1.]] > From [[DF 1.2_10.]] > Blurriness(x) := > A property of an Experience E(MoE(x), CoE(y)), representing the degree to which the truth or actuality of a particular aspect of CoE(y) is _spread over multiple possible candidates or alternatives_, rather than being sharply focused on a single, definite content. > - High blurriness: Many possible alternatives for CoE(y) remain plausible (i.e., the subject's experience is distributed or "smeared" across options, with no single one being certain). > - Low blurriness: Experience is sharply focused on a single option; only one CoE(y) is considered true or actual for this experience. > > Formally we say > Let Y$_i$ be the set of possible alternatives for a particular CoE(y) that also includes y. > - Blurriness(E(x,y)) = The _probability distribution_ over Y$_i$ as assigned by the subject's SoE(x). > - If all weight is on one y$_i\in$Y$_i$, blurriness is zero (maximal focus). > - If weight is spread, blurriness is high (maximal blur). We say Blurriness is the degree to which the content of a particular experience is not resolved to a single definite option, but is instead distributed across several possibilities, each with a certain plausibility or likelihood, as assessed by the subject. In the extreme, blurriness is maximal when all options are equally plausible; it is minimal when one option is uniquely distinguished as actual. [[CR 1.2_4x1.]] From [[DF 1.2_10.]] and [[DF 1.2_6.]] Believing the same CoE(x) more or less influences how the CoE(x) is experienced. It therefore follows that believing(x) is a MoE. We redefine [[DF 0.5_1. (DF 0.10)]] as >[[DF 1.2_11.]] >From [[DF 0.5_1. (DF 0.10)]], [[DF 1.2_10x1.]] >doubting := SoE that Specifies how uncertain a Subject is regarding a Believe. >We say doubting specifies how blurry an E is. and define >[[DF 1.2_12.]], From [[DF 1.2_10x1.]] trusting := SoE that Specifies how certain a Subject is regarding a Believe We say trusting specifies how not blurry an E is. >[[CR 1.2_5.]] >From [[DF 1.2_10.]], [[DF 1.2_11.]] and [[DF 1.2_12.]] >The trusting and doubting a subject performs has influence on the degree to which believing(x) is taking place. >[[DF 1.2_13.]] >From [[CR 1.2_4x1.]] Doubt := MoE where doubting is maximal and trusting is minimal >[[DF 1.2_14.]] >From [[CR 1.2_4x1.]] >Trust := MoE where trusting is maximal and doubting is minimal >[[CR 1.2_6.]] >From [[CR 1.2_5.]] and [[CL 1.2_1.]] [[DF 1.2_13.]] and [[DF 1.2_14.]] >There are two MoE Doubt and Trust and CoE(y) where E(Doubt, y)$\neq$E(Trust,y) Further it holds that >[[CR 1.2_7.]] >From [[DF 1.2_8.]] and [[DF 1.2_9.]] >A subject expressing doubt regarding its capability to doubt is a SC leading to a SN of said statement. >The important of this SC is that if the S has Doubt that is has the capability to Doubt it would translate to I am uncertain that i can be uncertain. >This can express multiple things. >The crux of this SC is that there are 2 cases: >1) External: The S is structurally performing what it is questioning. So from the outside we have a clear PC. Where S performs the act it is uncertain of. >2) Internal: The internal case isn't as straightforward. If the MoE(Doubt) truly holds for the subject it isn't so to speak trivially inconsistent to doubt any statement. However the statement CoE(x) is not necessarily what is doubted. This can be made clearer when we understand doubting as blurriness of CoE(x) where the subject is uncertain regarding any specifics of CoE(x). Because Doubting itself is not a negation of a statement. Therefore it doesn't follow that the Subject perceives a statement to be either true or false. This highlights that the internal SC is not in relation to any CoE(x) and rather in relation to there being: > 1) A Subject at all, > 2) Any SoE being the case > 3) The structural experience of MoE(Doubt). > So in a sense the DS would be uncertain regarding the presence of the ES-Tuple and its components or structural facts of SoE. > This expresses that the DS doubts that it could be possible that either: > a) There is a Subject that can experience > ($\lnot$S,SoE,CoE) > b) There is way experience feels like > (S, $\lnot$SoE, CoE) > c) There is any content that can be doubted > (S, SoE, $\lnot$CoE) > d) This current experience of doubting is taking place > (S, $\lnot$MoE(Doubt), CoE) > holds. > If any of a)-c) where the case the ES performing Doubt wouldn't be an ES. Therefore it is a SC for any subject to doubt that it is an ES. The proposed uncertainty is always negated by the fact that there is an ES that is in Doubt. > Therefore no ES can truly doubt the ES-Tuple without contradicting itself via the fact of there being an ES with experience. > Regarding d) the case is a bit more pronounced since it is not the ES-Tuple itself that is doubted but this experience that is occurring now. > While it is certainly possible to doubt if an experience maps correctly to the world (believing it is just an illusion) it is not possible to doubt that there is a current experience that is experienced the way it is. > So doubting 4) by mainting that the current experience is not experienced is a SC proven by the very fact that there is a specific experience taking place. >Importantly we can say that those SC's expressed hold internally and no subject can doubt it's own currently experienced experience structurally. As Analogy for the statement that doubt is not a statement about truth of falsity of a claim we can imagine a jar filled with sand. If a person appears and states there are exactly x grains of sand in in this jar we would naturally feel doubtful regarding the statement however we wouldn't necessarily presume that it can't be the case. We would only express a high distrust of the statement. Afterall it could be quite abig range of more grains or less grains of sand then the amount x that was stated. We say >[[CR 1.2_8.]] >From [[CR 1.2_7.]] and [[DF 1.2_15.]] It is a SF that the there is an ES with a current experience. in other words no subject can doubt/truthfully hold that it is not an ES or not having a current experience >[[CR 1.2_9.]] >From [[DF 1.2_8.]] [[DF 1.2_9.]] >A subject trusting it's statement that it can't be trusting of statements is a SC that leads to a SN of the statement We now define the DS as > [[DF 1.2_16.]] > Doubting Subject (DS) := A subject that has MoE(Doubt) regarding all contents. We say ES-Tuple of the DS is (DS, MoE(Doubt), CoE) We say that the DS is a specific subject with default MoE being maximal doubting. Importantly we can say >[[CR 1.2_10.]] >From [[CR 1.2_7.]] and [[DF 1.2_5.]] >There are SoE the DS can't Doubt without SC >[[CR 1.2_11.]] >From [[CR 1.2_10.]] >Limiting the ability of the DS to perform SC leads to there CoE(x) that is true by the fact of them being SN of CoE($\lnot$x) making those statements expressions of SF and >[[CR 1.2_12.]] >From [[CR 1.2_3.]] >A DS that is not able to hold SC as true can't break the ES-Tuple or have CoE that lead to SC with SoE. >[[CR 1.2_13.]] >From [[CR 1.2_10.]], [[CR 1.2_11.]] [[CR 1.2_12.]] and [[DF 1.2_16.]] >A DS limited in its ability to hold CoE as true that lead to a SC is not able to doubt certain CoE and can hold certain CoE as being true. The intention behind this is that with further exploration of SoE we build up or limit the CoE of the DS. While we still are agnostic as outside observers regarding z in (DS, SoE,CoE(z)) it allows us to theoreticaly reason that if z was a true CoE the DS would be able to recognize it as such. This allows us to establish the observed insights as Foundational truths that hold even for a DS and therefore expanding the justifed set of SoE that even a DS could hold as true. Once a SoE is justifably establish we assume the DS to always be structurally aware of the established SoE allowing us to level up the DS as we explore it's SoE. Before we proceed further we need to ground the concept of "Now" in context of the ES-Tuple. The concept of Now is hinted at in [[FT 0.2_1-R.]] "You are currently aware of this statement." If we translate this into the ES-Tuple we can say that >[[CR 1.2_14.]] >From [[FT 0.2_1-R.]] The ES Tuple of [[FT 0.2_1-R.]] is: (You, currently aware, this statement) or put differently we say >[[CR 1.2_15.]] >From [[FT 0.2_1-R.]] Abstractly speaking we say that there is a specific experience E$_x$(SoE,CoE) which is currently experience by a subject. We say S has E$_x$ If we try to understand what currently tries to express we see that it expresses that there is a specific experience that a subject has instead of the subject having all E(SoE,CoE) at once. What this describes is an abstract location. Abstract in the sense that is not physical temporal or spatial location and rather something that makes a E$_x$ something specific that is distinct from having all experiences (E$_{all}$) at once. >[[CR 1.2_16.]] >From [[CR 1.2_15.]] >A specific E$_x$is not the same as E$_{all}$ >We say E$_x\subset$ E$_{all}$ >[[DR 1.2_2.]] >From [[CR 1.2_16.]] [[DF 1.2_13.]] [[DF 1.2_14.]] [[CR 1.2_1.]] >If there would be no E$_x\subset$ E$_{all}$ the subject would experience everything combined at once. >This would mean that different experiences >$\exists$x,y: E$_x\neq$E$_y$ wouldn't be possible. >Further it would also mean that at the same time CoE(x) and CoE($\lnot$x) would be experienced and that all different MoE would hold in the same instance so Doubt(x) and Trust(x) would both hold. >This would lead us to the following conclusions >1) CoE would negate/cancel itself out meaning there is no CoE this is a SC because we experience specific content >2) All MoE would be the case negating them being MoE because MoE are understood as different experiences of the same content. If all MoE hold then CoE(x) would be experienced exactly the same way. SC of concept MoE. >3) There would be no different experiences We therefore can say >[[CR 1.2_17.]] >From [[DR 1.2_2.]] >It is a SC if a subject Trusts statement there are no specific experiences >We say > (S, SoE(Trust), CoE(x)) where x is statement >$\nexists$ x,y: E$_x\neq$E$_y$ >is a SC We are therefore justified to define Now as location >[[DF 1.2_17.]] >Now := Abstract location of experience the subject has The [[DF 1.2_17.]] is kept deliberately vague because it serves to express that every experience if experienced is experienced in the Now however this doesn't mean there isn't a specific experience being in the Now in this instance. As analogy we could imagine a person walking around. It would be true to state that every position the person occupied was an occupied position without needing to claim that there can't be positions that aren't occupied currently or that the occupied positions are all possible positions there are. We therefore define >[[DF 1.2_18.]] >Now(x) := Specifies the specific experience E$_x$ that currently is in Now >[[CR 1.2_18.]] >From [[DF 1.2_17.]] and [[DF 1.2_18.]] >$\forall$ x: E$_x\in$Now for E$_x\subset$E >and >$\exists$ x,y: E$_x\neq$E$_y$ where Now(E$_x$)$\land$$\lnot$Now(E$_y$) >(There exist two different Experiences where one is currently taking place and the other isn't) >[[CR 1.2_19.]] >From [[CR 1.2_18.]] >Now is the abstract space of possible experiences >[[CR 1.2_20.]] >From [[CR 1.2_18.]] >Now(x) is the specific location in Now of the experience E the subject S has in this instance. >We say Now(x)$\subset$Now and Now$\subseteq$SoE >this implies that specific experience x is had by the subject and other experiences y are not had in the same instance Crucially we can also derive >[[DR 1.2_3.]] >From [[CR 1.2_18.]] and [[CR 1.2_20.]] >$\lnot$Now(x) doesn't imply that x is in Now. >Because x specifies an abstract location and x doesn't necessarily need to be an experience. >Expressed differently if there is an x that is not experience it still holds that x is not in Now(x) >We state: >If $\exists$ x: x$\not\subseteq$ E $\to$ x$\not\in$Now >and because >Now(x)$\subset$Now >it follows that >x$\not\in$Now(x) >We express this as >$\lnot$Now(x) >We can formulate this as: >x is not in the now because it isn't an experience With the formulated points in this chapter we now have a clearer understanding of what an ES is and how it should be conceptualized. Further the ES-Tuple and SC allows us to express and structure insights regarding the ES and provide us with the language to model an ES and level it up during our further investigations. The ES-Tuple and SN further provides us with insights regarding SoE superseeding SoE and the option for even a DS that is limited by SC to have true CoE. Finally it was established how we can understand Doubting and that Now(x) is a location that expresses that a specific experience is currently present to a subject. ## 1.3 Presence of DS Assuming the subject from section 0 performs Doubt as detailed above meaning we assume it performs doubt to a maximal degree possible on CoE making it a DS. We formulate this as: >[[AS 1.3_1.]] >The subject reflecting on this thoughts is applying MoE(Doubt) of whatever CoE it has. We say $\exists$ ES =(DS, MoE(Doubt),CoE) >[[CR 1.3_1.]] >From [[AS 1.3_1.]] and [[DF 1.2_13.]] [[CR 1.2_7.]] >A DS can't doubt that it is present without SC since doubting requires a subject. [[SF 1.3_1]] From [[CR 1.3_1.]] The ES and the ES-Tuple are present and a structural Fact for the DS [[CR 1.3_2.]] From [[CR 1.2_10.]] There are statements that can't be doubted by the DS without SC [[CR 1.3_3.]] From [[AS 1.3_1.]], [[CR 1.2_19.]] and [[CR 1.2_20.]] Being an DS entails a specific experience E$_x$ in the Now. We say Now(E$_x$) [[CR 1.3_4.]]Cf 1.3_1 From [[CR 1.3_3.]] , [[CR 1.2_15.]], [[CR 1.2_12.]], [[SF 1.3_1]], [[CR 1.2_7.]] and [[DF 1.2_7.]] [[DF 1.2_17.]] Because Experience E(SoE, CoE) is defined as a grouping of components of the ES-Tuple and we know that the complete ES-Tuple holds for the DS the grouping can't be doubted by the DS without SC since it would require doubting components of the ES-Tuple or doubting that SoE and CoE can be grouped. Further the DS can't doubt that there is a specific Experience E$_x$ taking place Now as Now(E$_x$) without SC. Because the Expierience the DS has is the only Expierience it knows and we defined Now as the abstract location of experience. As Analogy we can envision a RDS as a toddler that just touched a hot pot. Even if didn't know that it felt pain it would know out of the SoE that this experience is happening. [[SF 1.3_2.]] From [[CR 1.3_4.]] This experience is the case [[CF 1.3_1.]]CF 1.3_2 From [[SF 1.3_2.]] 1) If the experience *wasn't the case* then there would be no experience structurally negating the fact that there is a DS. This is a SC. 2) If *this experience* isn't the case it either implies that: 1) a different experience (not *this experience*) is the case. Meaning there was still an experience that is the case but because we didn't formulate specifics of the experience this would be nonsensical. It also requires a DS to differentiate experiences. This contradicts the definition of the DS. So the *this* in the statement doesn't mean the DS knows specifics of the experience itself and rather that there is a experience that is the case.(whatever specific experience it might be) 2) something is the case but it wasn't an *experience* negating the DS as subject and breaking the ES-Tuple. This is a SC 3) the DS wouldnt expierience *an experience* therefore negating the DS being a subject and breaking the ES-Tuple. This is a SC Clarification: experince being the case doesn't mean that the DS experiencing something is aware of the "being the caseness" per se. We are stating that this experience is structurally the case Therefore the DS could become aware of the structural fact that something is the case but doesn't necessarily do so. Analogy: Someone being angry might not actively be thinking "I am angry" and instead just feeling angry without the realization [[CR 1.3_5.]] From [[SF 1.3_2.]] and [[CR 1.3_3.]] This experience E$_x$ of the DS is the case Now(E$_x$)
[L394-L420] labels=7 flags=1 paragraphs=19
Labels: Lets briefly reason and conceptualize what [[CR 1.3_5.]] actually means., [[DR 1.3_1.]], With this reasoning about [[CR 1.3_5.]] we can state from the DS perspective that, [[FT 1.3_2.]] experience happening now entails change, [[CF 1.3_2.]], From [[FT 1.3_2.]], For [[FT 1.3_2.]] to be properly expressed we need to revisit the definition of change
- L418: If Happening now wouldn't entail change we would describe experience happening now as the only static point (see above reasoning) which is in contradiction with the definition of ES.

### 1.4 Conceptualizing Change In chapter 0.7 we introduced Change. We stated that [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] Change:= We understand change as that which produces difference. Or in other words as something that makes difference occur. and that [[FT 0.7_1. (FT 0.3)]] Change takes place Further we concluded that [[CR 0.7_1. (CR 0.4)]] From [[SUM 0.6_1. (Sum 0.3)]] and [[FT 0.7_1. (FT 0.3)]] If something is experienced differently from something else there is change that allows us to distinguish the different experiences. and [[CR 0.7_2. (CR 0.5)]] From [[CR 0.7_1. (CR 0.4)]] and [[CF 0.7_1. (CF 0.10)]] You(a subject) having experience now implies that there is change happening now To understand how change would relate to and appear to the DS we need a more rigorous formulation what we mean with change. [[CR 1.4_1.]] From [[DR 1.2_3.]] Expresses that it could be the case that $\exists$ x$\not\in$Now to properly express the abstract location for this x we define [[DF 1.4_1.]] Occurrence(x) := Expresses that x is an abstract point int the Superset of Now. We say Now$\subseteq$Occurrence [[DF 1.4_2.]] Happening(x):= Occurrence(x) is the case / is taking place. We say x is happening/ x is the currently present location in Occurance [[CR 1.4_2.]] From [[AS 1.3_1.]], [[DF 1.4_1.]] [[DF 1.4_2.]] [[CR 1.2_20.]] and [[CR 1.3_5.]] There exists an ES with a specific E$_x$ that is the case Now(E$_x$) Because Now(E$_x$)$\subset$Occurrence it follows that Occurrence(E$_x$) Because it is a structural fact that E$_x$ is the case it follows Happening(E$_x$) (This experience E$_x$ is happening) We say $\exists$ Happening(E$_x$)$\subseteq$SoE and therefore the more general expression Happening(x)$\subseteq$SoE and Occurrence$\subseteq$SoE holds. Since we concluded that Happening(E$_x$) $\land$ Now(E$_x$) (Experience E$_x$ is happening and E$_x$ is in Now(x)) we can state that Happening(Now(E$_x$)) This expierience is happening now We reformulate ES = (S,SoE,CoE) as ES =(S, E$_x$) where E$_x$ = (SoE(x), CoE(x)) We write ES = (S, E$_x$) as ES = (S, E(SoE(x),CoE(x))) We can therefore say $\exists$x such that for the adjusted form it holds that $\exists$ ES = (DS, E(Happening(Now(x)),CoE(x))) CR 1.4_3. From [[CR 1.4_2.]] We can state that whatever Experience E$_x$ the DS has it is happening meaing it is Now(x). Crucially the E$_x$ happening now means that the E$_x$ of the DS is structurally evident to the DS because it is whatever Expierience that is the case for the DS and that Experience structurally entails that the subject experiences E$_x$ as happening now. SF 1.4_1. From CR 1.4_3. It is a structural fact that any ES including the DS expierience an E$_x$ as happening in Now(x) We say $\forall$ ES $\exists$ E$_x$ Where Happening(Now(E$_x$)) CR 1.4_4. Crucially it also holds that since every DS experiences an E$_x$ as Happening Now we say every ES structurally knows that it is experiencing something now. DF 1.4_3. From CR 1.4_4. Structural Knowledge (SK) := For every structural fact we state that the DS or any ES has structural knowledge of the specific structural fact. This means that the ES knows in an undeniable experienced way that the established SF's are the case. Knowledge in this context doesn't mean that an ES knows in an "intellectual" sense that something is the case and rather in an it is selfevidently included in it's experience. For example if we say that it is a SF that a ES has the ES-Tuple it doesn't mean that a DS could actually formulate the tuple and rather that it is self evident to the DS that it exists, that it expieriences content or that it is experienceing in such an essential way that it just knows that this is the case. Since SF and SK are so closely linked and evident we can plausibly assume that if a DS had even minimal capability to formulate something it would be able to with minimal intellectual overhead formulate the SF's expressed in this text. We say every SF implies SK of even a DS. And vice versa any SK argued for a DS implies the presence of a SF. CR 1.4_5. From SF 1.4_1. and DF 1.4_3. The DS strukturally knows (SK) that this Experience E$_x$ is Happening Now In other words the DS has SK of Happening(Now(E$_x$)) With this established we can focus on change. # Temp If we express [[FT 1.3_2.]] using this definition we get: [[FT 1.3_2.]] experience happening now entails that something happens Using this definition of change would be not properly expressing meaningful what we want to express using the term change. Happening now entailing that something happens is a trivial statement. The reason is not because this definition is wrong an instead the reason is that change is a non trivial concept that can express more then fits in one definition and itself as concept is simple but still hard to grasp because it's loaded and we are at the edge of intelligibility when talking about it. What the term change in FT1.3 tries to express is that change is what spawns happening. Or in onther words that which makes the happening take place. This doesn't mean that [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] Change as that which happens is wrong. Because change itself is soemthing that happens. If change wouldnt happen there would be no change but in a different sense change is that which changes change and makes change and other occurances happen. This is what this entire chain of reasoning is trying to explain and get at so in a sense it's clear zhat the above statements at this point are still underdefined because we need to explore the reasoning chain further to understand how change as ontological primary itself spawns what we experience as reality. If it can be shown that change as ontological primary has the productive capability to do that it is in a sense trivially true that the term change that spawns all of this can't just be summarized in one definition. We can illustrate this new kind of understanding of change as "If there is no change nothing happens." But if there is nothing happening this doesn't mean necessarily that there is no change and rather that we can't recognize change. While we wont attempt to show this now we can hint at this by stating the statement "experience happens" in different forms. If we would assume that happening is just a different term for change we would get "experience changes" which would be true as elaborated above but express something different then "experience happens" so there seems to be difference in the understanding of the terms. Tvis is a hint that happening is not the exact same as change and with the understanding of no change meaning no happening takes place we see that we can understand the term happening as an expression of change that is understandable for a subject but for now the difference between the meaning of happening vs change is underexpressed. We establish a different definition of change that is [[DF 1.3_1.]] Change:= That which enables happening If we restate [[FT 1.3_2.]] "experience happening now entails change" with [[DF 1.3_1.]] we get "experience happening now entails that there is something that enables happening". Which is not a trivial statement like [[FT 1.3_2.]] with the other definition of change was. Lets continue by envisioning us asking the RDS Q1.2 Was this experience always happening? where the presumed answer would be A 1.2 "No, I became aware of it" Allowing us to state [[CR 1.3_6.]] From [[DF 0.4_1. (DF 0.7)]], [[DF 1.3_1.]] , [[SF 1.3_2.]] and [[FT 1.3_2.]] The DS is an ES being aware of experience.([[DF 0.4_1. (DF 0.7)]]). That has an experience now that is happening ([[SF 1.3_2.]]) and experiencing now entailing change ([[FT 1.3_2.]]) and that Change is what enables happening ([[DF 1.3_1.]] ). This leads to the ES not only being aware but also becoming aware of the experience. Because if the ES has an experience that happens now and is aware of it means that the ES having experience happening now formulates that there is change in this now that can be expressed as the happening of experience and the related awareness is not just an expression of being aware and instead of a becoming aware via the happening of said experience. In short we state: The DS becomes aware of experience The fact that change enables happening to take place ([[DF 1.3_1.]] ) allows us to define [[DF 1.3_2.]] Arising := Change leading to something happening [[CR 1.3_7.]] From [[CR 1.3_6.]] and [[DF 1.3_2.]] The DS's experience arose. This can be expressed in a more rigorous fashion. In [[CR 1.3_5.]] we saw that experience happening leads to the DS *becoming* aware. So experience happening leads to awareness arising. Meaning change spawning happening and happening being a structurally true statement of experience that can be reformulated as awareness means that experience happening leads to awareness arising meaning awareness was spawned from change spawning happening and the fact that experience is happening. If we quickly stop here and reflect with a human perspective we see that awareness of a experience means that change is taking place in the now and crucially that experiencing structurally via the change present in it and the expression of *arisal* means that arisal as a core fact of experience creates a structural pointer that points outside of the DS. Formulated differently the Answer to Q1.2 where the RDS states that it became aware of this experience indicates a structural possibility of a DS to realize that there is a not now. This can be stated because the arisal of experience now indicates that there is a different point from which it arose that is not the now. To clarify we don't claim that this realization is clear to DS or RDS in a trivial sense. This can be illustrated by reenvisoning the toddler that touched a hot pot. The toddler would be overwhelmed by the pain (CoE) and not performing deep reflections that pain arising in it means there was a point where the pain wasn't happening. Nonetheless the structural possibility for it to perform this reflection because it is entailed in the structure of it experience (SoE) means that it at least in theory could do so. This justifies us leveling up the DS in such a way that we say due to this structural realization being possible from the structure of experience we can now assume a DS knows this structural fact and that there is a pointer. This pointer and its implications will be explored in the next sections but before we progress we need to consider some insights and points. We saw that change is in the now and formulate [[DF 1.3_3.]] C(Now) := Change is present in the now. Further we should note that Change by its nature points over/out of/above the now. We are currently less concerned with what the pointer itself is and expresses and more focused on the abstract ability of change to point outside the current context. Further the following point of clarifcation is appropriate. C(now) actually implies that there is difference in the now internally and this points to the fact that now is not actually a point and rather an area. But this has not yet been explored and for now we are concerned with the aspect of C(now) that points outside of the now. So for now we keep change in the now unexplored and therefore still conceptualize now as a abstract complext point. We choose this because it simplifies the investigations in the next sections. But we will keep this underexploration in mind and revisit it later. # 2 The Pointer In the prior section we briefly explored the presence of a pointer entailed in experience. In this section we want to explore this pointer and its implications. As humans not a DS we need to reflect before we can enter the DS again. We defined C(now) as: [[DF 1.3_3.]] C(Now) := Change is present in the now. and we derived that [[CR 1.3_7.]] From [[CR 1.3_6.]] and [[DF 1.3_2.]] The DS's experience arose. Meaning that the DS can become aware of the fact that experience arose. Where arisial of experience with [[DF 1.3_2.]] Arising := Change leading to something happening Points to change being what makes experience arise [[CR 2.1_1.]] From [[CR 1.3_7.]] and [[DF 1.3_2.]] Change led to the DS's experience. And to its potential experiencing of this structural fact as SoE. If something arises this means that whatever arose wasn't there when it hadnt yet arisen or was still in the process of arising. Arising expresses that there is something new happening. The being new structurally includes an expression that there is sth else. We can state [[CR 2.1_2.]] From [[CR 2.1_1.]] The experience of the DS now entails C(now) Further we expand or clarify the Definition of change. We prior used this Definitions of Change [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] Change:= That what happens. and [[DF 1.3_1.]] Change:= That which enables happening lets reformulate them briefly as [[RF 2.1_1.]] Of [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] and [[DF 1.3_1.]] 1) Change happens ([[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]]) 2) Change enables happening([[DF 1.3_1.]]) So if we try to insert one definition into the other we get - That which enables happening happens ([[DF 1.3_1.]] inserted into [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]]) - That what happens enables happening ([[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] inserted into [[DF 1.3_1.]] ) What this highlights is not only that change leads to change but also that what happens changes. In essence this all is an expression of a fundamental understanding of change as dynamic in nature. This isn't just empty wordplay instead this reflections about the used definitions allows us to state that any difference that we notice was enabled by change. If nothing happened or no happening was enabled there could never be difference. Another way to express this is that the above definitions put together express that [[DF 2.1_1.]] Dynamic = happenings happen So the term dynamic expresses that change enables happening. We state [[FT 2.1_1.]] From [[DF 1.3_1.]] Change is dynamic [[CF2.1_1]] From [[FT 2.1_1.]] If there was no dynamism in change then nothing could happen. If change were entirely static we wouldn't speak of change or happenings taking place. This can be made clearer like this. We saw that happening entails change. If we reformulate [[FT 2.1_1.]] as Change is happenings happening. If there was pure stasis the happenings couldn't happen. There would just be an eternal sameness. This can be formulated like this If Static is the opposite of change(will be revisited later) and dynamic means happenings happen this would lead to 1) No happenings happen or 2) Happenings don't happen Either option leads to happenings not happening because there is no happening or nothing that happens. So if we would state that Chance is static we would say that Change means that nothing happens but we defined change in [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] as that what happens. So if there was no happening the term change wouldn't be meaningful since there is nothing that happens and therefore change as defined in [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] would never be the case. we formulate [[DF 2.1_2.]] Difference := that which tells happenings apart. We formulate [[DF 2.1_3.]] diff(x,y) := difference of happening x and happening y. Were Diff(x,y)=∅ expresses that there is no difference and diff(x,y) ≠ ∅ expresses that there is difference. [[CR 2.1_3.]] From [[FT 2.1_1.]] and [[CF2.1_1]] We see that "Change is dynamic"([[FT 2.1_1.]] ) is what is necessary for happenings because without change no happening would occur [[CR 2.1_4.]] From [[CR 2.1_3.]] and [[DF 2.1_2.]] Distinguishing happenings and formulating their difference requires Happenings [[CR 2.1_5.]] From [[CR 2.1_3.]] and [[CR 2.1_4.]] Change is necessary for difference [[CR 2.1_6.]] From [[CR 2.1_5.]] If there is difference it is a result of change From this reflections we can understand that happenings and their arisal express difference. Since the DS is aware of a experience happening and it's arisal expresses difference a DS has the capability to regonize difference or hints of differenece as structurally included in the arisal of a experience. We express this structural hint of difference as [[DF 2.1_4.]] Tension := Structural reference to difference entailed in change. To increase our vocabulary we also define [[DF 2.1_5.]] Unfolding := Arisal happening Reminder [[DF 1.3_2.]] Arising := Change leading to something happening We can say change unfolds and that this unfolding entails Tension. To respect the neede rigor we have to express this more concretely. [[FT 2.1_1.]] Change is dynamic can be restated as [[RF 2.1_2.]] Of [[FT 2.1_1.]] Change is happenings happening [[CR 2.1_8.]] From [[RF 2.1_2.]] and [[DF 2.1_2.]] if there is a happening it is different from other happenings. Or formulated differently if there is no difference it is the same happening. [[DF 2.1_6.]] happening$_{new}$ := arisal of happening y where $\nexists$ happening x such that diff(x,y)$= \emptyset$ [[CR 2.1_9.]] From [[DF 1.3_2.]], [[DF 2.1_6.]] and [[DF 2.1_5.]] If there is a new happening([[DF 2.1_6.]]) arising something new is unfolding [[CR 2.1_10.]] From [[CR 2.1_9.]] and [[DF 2.1_4.]] If there is a new unfolding this unfolding is change and from the fact of it being new entails that there is difference [[CR 2.1_11.]] From [[CR 2.1_10.]] if new unfolding is change that entails difference we can say that unfolding entails tension. We already expressed prior that a DS might be overwhelmed by CoE and that it not necessarily actively is aware of this structural fact of experience. The same applies to change unfolding or the tension entailed in it. But due to the structural fact of SoE it is theoretically possible to envision a DS aware of this SoE. As stated prior the fact that unfolding and tension are SoE we are permitted to level the DS as something that is aware of this SoE Therefore this improved DS now unlocks new potential reasoning in RDS form. We already did this partially in section 1 but now with our additional reflections on change we provide a richer tool set to talk about this. We already formulated [[CR 2.1_2.]] From [[CR 2.1_1.]] The experience of the DS now entails C(now) but with this additional reflections we now understand that C(now) also expresses an unfolding in C(now). We can state that [[CR 2.1_12.]] From [[CR 2.1_2.]] and [[DF 2.1_5.]] C(now) is unfolding We reflected prior that if the DS is aware of a Experience this experience is in the now. or in other words if we concieve there was the exact same expernce "next to" a specific experience those two experiences are perceived by the DS as the same experience. or reformulated the subject couldnt be aware of them as different experiences. Both experiences would be the same experience in the now to the DS This leads to [[CR 2.1_13.]] From [[CR 2.1_12.]] experience in C(now) can be understood as a new happening [[CR 2.1_14.]] From [[CR 2.1_13.]] experience happening now entails Tension or restated experience happening now entails Structural reference to difference. Since we leveled up the DS it is capable of being aware of this tension. [[CR 2.1_15.]] From [[CR 2.1_14.]] The DS is aware of Tension. and therefore of implied difference. As point of clarification implied difference is not the same thing as difference as we defined it since difference would mean that the DS would be aware of two happenings which would smuggle a memory like structure allowing this awareness. We therefore Define [[DF 2.1_7.]] Pointer ⭦(x) := implied difference in a happening. Where x refers to what is pointed to. We saw in [[CR 2.1_15.]] that the DS is aware of this tension and difference expressed in it allowing it to point to difference implied by tension. So we state [[CR 2.1_16.]] From [[CR 2.1_15.]] and [[DF 2.1_7.]] Since the difference is not completely contained in the experience the DS is capable of pointing to something else Lets briefly reflect on this. Since we still understand now as a point and the DS is not aware of CoE it currently makes no sense that the pointer points to a different experience since this would require to know the content of this experience. However the DS is structurally aware of it's experience happening now so the only reasonable thing the pointer can point to is $\lnot$now. where the content of $\lnot$now is not known or intelligible for the DS. Therefore the pointer is a structural pointer pointing to the only conceivable other there is. Further the fact that this experience arose and the arisal being what expresses the Tension that allows formulating a pointer leads us the formulation that $\lnot$now is what this experience arose from. This is not meant to express a causal relationship in the classical sense and rather expresses that if there is a $\lnot$now and this experience is now and new and therefore wasn't always the case then the only thing leading to this experience is $\lnot$now or in other words whatever could be the case when this experience wasn't the case is $\lnot$now. With the DS structural awareness of something arising where change is what leads to arisal of experience we can formulate [[DF 2.1_8.]] Prior := that which lead to the current arisal Clarification: Prior at this stage is just a label. The term was chosen because it hints at $\lnot$now being before. But this hasn't yet been shown and will be done later on. For now $\lnot$now has not been shown to clearly be structurally prior or anything specific therefore $\lnot$now could be anything or nothing. If we quickly imagine temporality it could be before or after. If we quickly imagine a 2d space and we envision now as location with now being a specific point then $\lnot$now is any other point in the 2d space. Further arisal can currently not be understood as any causal relationship. The only thing we have is a subject pointing outwards. we can therefore state that the Pointer points to an unspecified prior that is understood as $\lnot$ now and that which lead to arisal of the DS's experience. Due to the fact that this entire reasoning is structural we can state that the DS in theory can be aware of or better formulated structurally know that there is something different that is prior by abstractly pointing to it when experiencing. This prior is as stated not a causal prior and rather the negation of now in the now. It is also worth highlighting that the now used is in common language used a temporal expression. This isn't the case here. Now only expresses the current and only point of experience the subject evident as being present by experience happening. However we could reformulate every now as point of this experience but we deliberately use now to aid the user in grasping what is going on and keep the intuition of what is being done fruitfull. This is perceived as justified because now expresses best, that we are speaking of happening in the moment of happening and presents itself as evident to human subjects. A different way to show the validity of now as non temporal term can be done like this. As a human subject certain experiences feel like they take forever if you are e.g. waiting or they feel like time flies when you enjoy them. So it's in that sense trivially true that now of experience doesn't trivially map to measured time. Basically abstracting common sense notion of experience would lead to over abstracting and confusing the reader. It is also worth highlighting that referring to now as abstract point at this stage of derivation would also spawn concerns like how would the ds know the abstract concept of points. # 3 $\lnot$Now and the pointer We hinted in the last section at a prior by defining it as [[DF 2.1_8.]] Prior := that which lead to the current arisal But this still needs clear derivation before it can be understood to hold structurally. Further $\lnot$now can only be hinted at as other that like now has no temporal or causal properties. Further we summarize very briefly that it is ultimately change itself that allows the subject to point to the other completely motivated out of C(now) highlighting that change is more fundamental then experience because it is necessary for happening and is what allowed the DS to point outside of it's experience. Lets star by grounding that the DS doesn't know what it points to or any properties the other would have. The pointing is purely a product of sensed tension and no logical derivations yet. The DS is so to speak not aware of any derivations of change done in the earlier section. So to enable more insights we now attempt to reason from/for a RDS perspective. [[CR 3.1_1.]] From [[CR 2.1_16.]] The DS has the capability to point outside of its experience [[CR 3.1_2.]] From [[CR 3.1_1.]] The capability to point outside experience allows the DS to become aware of it's pointing where what is pointed at is not part of it's experience. There's a sense of not this experience. [[CR 3.1_3.]] From [[CR 3.1_2.]] A RDS capable of rudimentary logic would be able to derive that what is pointed at is not this experience. Note the RDS is not aware of the pointer ⭦(x). This is a tool for the human reader to label the result of poiniting. [[CR 3.1_4.]] From [[CR 3.1_3.]] The DS can via Negation form the concept of $\lnot$thisexperience or other. [[CR 3.1_5.]] From [[CR 3.1_4.]] The RDS can ubterstand that what the DS is pointing to is $\lnot$thisexperience [[CR 3.1_6.]] From [[CR 3.1_5.]] and ? The DS knows that this experience is happening now structurally. [[CR 3.1_7.]] From [[CR 3.1_6.]] The RDS can conclude $\lnot$thisexperience is $\lnot$now by negating being aware of $\lnot$thisexperience Or more precisely negating awareness of what it is pointing at. [[CR 3.1_8.]] From ?? The DS can become aware of thishappening happening. Or innother words becoming aware of change. We recieved a crucial point with this. What we attempted to show is that the RDS can become structurally aware of three key building blocks we want to use for the argument of Change. Those Building blocks are 1) Change is known 2) Change is in the Now 3) Theres a structural reference of $\lnot$now We attempted to derive this logically using a RDS but it could be argued that even a DS could in some sense become aware of this by being aware of tensionNow where thensionNow is understood as structural property the DS could become aware of namely this takes place now, (I am experiencing now), the experience being novel(had to come from somewhere) and I didn't myself cause this. Or in other words awareness of something deeper then the happening leading to this current happenings arisal including awareness of not creating this itself, and awareness of something other. Arguably this could all be understood as entailed in tension. So it wouldn't be to big of a leap to even for a DS assume capability of being aware of this tension and therefore having at least in theory access to this structural facts even when not being able to name them. We attempted to derive it via the RDS to have a clearer seperation of the building blocks and to show that it could also be possible to derive it. Regarsing the derivation of the RDS it is possible for them to not necessarly require memory because they are structural facts. So in a sense we could formulate that "(structural)awareness/knowledge of tension" and "(structural)awareness/knowledge of this happening" -> structural awareness/knowledge of other. and similarly (structural)awareness/knowledge of arisal" and "(structural)awareness/knowledge of tension" -> structural awareness/knowledge of change and (structural)awareness/knowledge of arisal" and "(structural)awareness/knowledge of this happening" -> structural awareness/knowledge of now. Neither of those needs memory or time in a sense it can be more understood that structural awareness of both entails this information and can be uncovered logically while awareness of change as a concept itself maybe is a to strong statement. With these 3 building blocks we can start to attempt to construct an argument about change for the DS. But first we need to define an updated way of writing pointer ⭦(x) with definition [[DF 2.1_7.]] Pointer ⭦(x) := implied difference in a happening. Where x refers to what is pointed to. With the new insights about change and We introduce a new Definition to state [[DF 3.1_1.]] Pointer (x⇖y) := where we say y points to x. Where we denote y as Pointer Origin and x as Target. We can justify this by stating that we as external observers/RDS can see that the DS points at an other from now this makes the DS pointing a pointer from y to x. Earlier we defined [[DF 1.3_2.]] Arising := Change leading to something happening The arising is something the subject senses or is aware of not necessarily as content but instead as the structural fact of something happening now as something that became. So experience becoming aware can be formulated as the DS sensing the struvturally becoming present in the now without requiring remembering or deduction and only feeling something as newly occuring. we say: [[DF 3.1_2.]] Arisal(x) := Change led to x becoming-present Importantly Arising(x) were arising is based on change can be understood as a structural property of change. experience arising or better put a specific experience arising is a special case of change leading to arisal happening. Similarly we can formulate happening along the same lines. Since like arisal happening requires change we can generalize happening as something resulting from the structural properties of change. More generally put we can state that while the terms arisal and happening refer to structural properties of existence they structurally require change. Therefore we can say that change has the capability to produce arisial and happenings as experienced by the subject. In order to have clear terminology we say that: Arisal(x) is the general capability of change to produce something that if experienced by a subject would be labeled arisal. Since we know that there is at least one arisal we can state $\exists x: (Arisal(x))$ or in other words the Amount of x where Arisal(x) is the case is at least 1. Similarly we can state that change has the capability to produce a happening so we can say that $\exists x:(Point(x))$ meaning the amount of x that can be conceptualized as Point implied by change is at least 1. Where point is a general notion of something that would be conceptualized as a happening if experienced by a subject. This allows us to express the more general notion of Points and Arisals that don't necessary require being experienced (in the classical sense). So a point x can arise (Arisal(x)) by the capabilities of change even when there is no subject present. Further the subjects ability to point allows us to formulate that since the tension utilized by the subject to point to an other is derived from change that change structurally entails the fact that at least for one point y there exists and other (point) x that is implied by change itself in point y. We say $\exists x: (x⇖y)$ this implies that $\exists y: (x⇖y)$ At this point we still haven't shown that y is a point in the same sense as x. For now however we assume that y is a point like x with the caveat that this still needs to be shown. To proceed properly we need to revisit other definitions we recall [[DF 2.1_8.]] Prior := that which lead to the current arisal We reformulate this as Prior(y) := The x that is pointed at by y. (x⇖y). Alternatively we can say that Prior(y) := That which lead to Arisal(y) This is valid since the DS ability to point is based on the fact that x arose. To have a more general and intuitive notion of Pointer we invert the pointers direction. we say that ↝ ∿ [[DF 3.1_3.]] structurallyPointsTo (⇘):= "x⇘y" means: x is a structural prior of y that, by virtue of being pointed at, enables the arisal of y as different. This is not a causal or temporal arrow, but a structural precondition for newness at y. (x⇘y):= x points to y as implied by the structural ability of pointing in y. Put differently we say $\exists y: (Arisal(y))$ and $Arisal(y)\implies \exists x:(Prior(x))$ Further we revisit [[DF 2.1_2.]] Difference := that which tells happenings apart. We relax [[DF 2.1_3.]] diff(x,y):= difference of happening x and happening y. Were Diff(x,y)=∅ expresses that there is no difference and diff(x,y) ≠ ∅ expresses that there is difference. To diff(x,y) := difference of abstract points x and y. Where points can be happenings but don't need to be. Since the DS points to something different because arisal implies that what arose wasn't the same we can state that $\exists x,y: (x⇘y)$ where diff(x,y)$\neq \emptyset$ if diff(x,y)=$\emptyset$ for (x⇘y) then x=y and Arisal(y)$\not\implies$ x since y didn't arise from itself. To summarize we can say that the ES experiences y as C(now) where C(now)$\implies\exists x,y: (x⇖y)$ and diff(x,y) $\neq\emptyset$ where y=now and x=$\lnot now$ were (x⇘y) is understood as Prior(y)⇘Arisal(y) It is worth reiterating that the pointer expresses a structural fact of change and not a causal relationship and no memory or temporarily is required by DS. If the DS is aware of change in C(now) all the deductions above are structurally entailed. To tie down this point we can consider that the DS experiences arisal of it's experience in C(now) as something new. Where New can be understood as that based on the experienced tension by DS the DS can point to at least to one other that is not part of it's experience. We say New(y):= $\exists x,y: (x⇘y)$ where x$\notin$ C(now) and y$\in$C(now) This allows us to state that even if CoE was exactly the same for x and y the being new implies that there is a difference diff(x,y)$\neq\emptyset$ that is purely structural expressed by the structural fact of a DS experiencing its experience as new. We can state New(y)$\implies$diff(x,y)$\neq\emptyset$ for Content(x)=Content(y)where Content(x) is defined as Content(x) := Content of experience (CoE) experienced by the DS Lets now reflect more deeply on Prior(x) pointed to by the subject where x is $\lnot$now. Previously we defined Change as: [[DF 1.3_1.]] Change:= That which enables happening we can restate this as [[DF 3.1_4.]] Change:= That which enables Arisal(y) of New(y) for atleast one y We now attempt to reason about change in x. We do this by arguing from Contradiction. we established that experience is happening now. Formulated as Premises (P) abd their derivations(D) and conclusions (Co) we state. P1: Change is happening Now in this current experience C(Now) We showed that the following can be stated 1) $\exists$ Now 2) $\exists y: y\in$ Now 3) $\exists y:$ (C(y)) 4) $\exists y:$ Arisal(y) 5) $\exists y:$ New(y) 6) $\exists y:$ C(y)$\implies$ Arisal(y)$\land$New(y) 7) $\exists y:$ C(y)$\land$ Arisal(y)$\land$ New(y) 8) $\exists x,y:$ Arisal(y)$\land$New(y)$\implies$ Prior(x) 9) $\exists x,y:$ x=Prior(y) where x$\notin$Now $\implies\exists\lnot$Now 10) $\exists$ Now, $\lnot$Now: Now$\neq\lnot$Now 11) $\exists ⇘:$($\lnot$Now ⇘ Now) 12) $\exists x,y:$ (x⇘ y)$\land (x=Prior(y))\land (y=Arisal(y)) \land (y=New(y))$ $\implies$ (Prior(y)⇘(Arisal(y)$\land$New(y))) 13) $\exists x: x\notin$ Now$\land$ x$\in\lnot$Now 14) $\exists y: y\in$ Now$\land$ y$\notin\lnot$Now 15) $\exists x,y:$ x$\notin$Now $\land$ y$\in$ Now$\implies$ diff(x,y) $\neq\emptyset$ 16) $\exists x,y:$⇘(x, y) where diff(x,y)$\neq\emptyset$ P2: We assume that there is a x=Prior(y) with no change at all in x we say $\lnot$C(x). Or in other words x is in pure stasis. D1: Something being in pure stasis can be expressed as $\lnot$C(x) and is not pointing to anything different. Or if formulated differently if there was a pointer in $\lnot$C(x) it could only point to itself/something where diff(x,y)=$\emptyset$ meaning x=y therefor the only possible pointer would be ⇘(x, x). If there would be $\exists x,y:$ (x⇘y) with diff(x,y)$\neq\emptyset$ that would mean that x would lead to $\lnot$x. Meaning x would change to something else. This would therefore imply that C(x) is the case. Note: x being understood as pure statsis means the complete absence of change. This should be trivial if we understand x as $\lnot$Now but just for completness sake we say there is no change in x or acting on x. expressed as $\lnot$C(x) P2 therefore states pure stasis of x ($\lnot$C(x)) expresses that $\nexists x,y:$ (x⇘ y) where diff(x,y)$\neq\emptyset$ D2 x is understood as that which was pointed at by the DS. This is expressing the structural fact that x is Prior of y where C(y) is the case.

### Strengths (what is structurally strong and unique):
[L425-L445] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=6
- L432: - "Performative contradiction" is foundational, blocking spurious claims.
- L444: - The protocol anticipates and encodes "collapse," "drift," and "structural negation" (SC/SN) as positive features.

### Critical Gaps and Weaknesses (what is missing or underexpressed):
[L446-L462] labels=0 flags=3 paragraphs=5
- L453: 3.
- L455: - There is a risk of motif drift: "We know there's an outside, but we don't (yet) exploit it for model-building."
- L457: - While the pointer/collapse protocol is present, there is not yet a mechanism for automated detection or correction of drift in a live agent context (outside human-driven criticality).

### Unique Contributions (relative to state of the art):
[L463-L467] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L465: - Recursive self-audit protocol (collapse, pointer, drift) baked into the theory itself--not just as meta-critique.

### Main Structural Risks:
[L468-L475] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### What Needs to be Done Next (critically):
[L476-L489] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=8
- L480: - Build a formal ledger/protocol for tracking frame shifts, pointer events, Gödel holes, and non-classical transitions--measurable and agent-readable.
- L484: - Implement (even as pseudocode) the recursive audit needed for transmission, error correction, and motif drift detection.

- L926: is this still translatable to classical tools like markov chains

###### [AI]
[L927-L930] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=2
- L929: No, this process is _not_ translatable to classical tools like Markov chains--except in degenerate, trivial cases where no real frame or variable change occurs.

## Here is why:
[L931-L931] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### 1. Markov Chains Have Fixed State Spaces
[L932-L937] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L933: - A Markov chain's "state space" is fixed in advance.
- L936: - Even "hidden" Markov models have a fixed structure (just unobserved states).

### 2. Your Ontology Allows Structure-Building
[L938-L942] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### 3. Classical Tools Cannot Represent Emergent Structure
[L943-L947] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L944: - Markov chains (and all tools in this class) can only model what is already present in the state space or transition matrix.
- L946: - Frame changes, recursive field expansion, and the "birth" of new variables are all _outside_ the expressive power of Markov chains.

### 4. Subset Selection in Markov Models
[L948-L952] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L951: - _In Markov, you can "filter" or "project" but you cannot _generate_ a new variable/dimension mid-run._

### 5. Only in Trivial or Retrospective Cases Can You "Emulate" This
[L953-L957] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L954: - If you _already know_ all possible decompositions and encode them in advance, you could write a "meta-Markov" model that can "switch" between them.

[L1033-L1035] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1

### 1. What is a Gödel Hole in This Context?
[L1036-L1041] labels=0 flags=3 paragraphs=0
- L1037: - Gödel hole:
- L1038: - A _structural gap_ in the reasoning chain--where the current system cannot prove, represent, or even reference what is needed to resolve a tension, contradiction, or collapse.
- L1039: - In classical logic: An unprovable truth within a system (Gödel's incompleteness).

### 2. What Happens at a Gödel Hole?

### 3. The Only Way Forward: Emergence
[L1050-L1055] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0

### 4. Gödel Holes as Drivers of Change
[L1056-L1066] labels=0 flags=4 paragraphs=0
- L1057: - In classical systems, Gödel holes are limits.
- L1059: - In your ontology, Gödel holes are also _invitations_:
- L1060: - Each Gödel hole marks a _point where the system must mutate, expand, or recurse_ in order to continue.
- L1062: - Surviving a Gödel hole means:

### 5. Operational Implications

- L1068: - Every time a pointer event, collapse, or tension is unresolvable, log a Gödel hole.
- L1070: 1.
- L1072: 3.

### 6. Why This Is Fundamentally Non-Classical

[L1105-L1105] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

#### A. Exhaustive Derivation Attempt
[L1106-L1109] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L1108: - If you succeed: Not a Gödel hole.
- L1109: - If you fail, and yet the system _requires_ an answer or reference (for consistency, survival, or closure): Mark this as a Gödel hole.

#### B. Collapse/Pointer Protocol
[L1110-L1116] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

#### C. Inductive Patterning
[L1117-L1120] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L1118: - Over many such events, map the "zones" or "classes" of experience, reasoning, or modeling that repeatedly produce Gödel holes.
- L1119: - E.g., in formal arithmetic, "truth of the consistency of arithmetic" is a Gödel hole; in a subject's experience, "unclassifiable difference" or "felt novelty that resists analysis" is a Gödel hole.

### 3. Visualization and Mapping
[L1121-L1132] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### 4. Meta-Formalization
[L1133-L1136] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L1134: - Gödel holes can be mapped "from outside" by a meta-agent with a larger toolkit, or "from inside" by exhaustively auditing all unresolved necessities.
- L1135: - In your ontology, every logged _pointer failure_, _structural contradiction_, or _required-but-unrepresentable difference_ is a mappable Gödel hole.

### 5. What Can You Do With This Map?
[L1137-L1144] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L1141: - Zones with the highest density of Gödel holes are where new variables, dimensions, or operators are most likely (or necessary) to emerge.
- L1143: - By explicitly mapping Gödel holes, you make it possible for successor agents to "know where to mutate" rather than being blind to system limits.

### 1. Is "change as eternal" itself a Gödel hole?
[L1216-L1223] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1
- L1221: - The "source" or "origin" of change is always a zone of unresolvable reference--a Gödel hole.

### 2. Specific Gödel Holes as Expressions of This Deep Structure
[L1224-L1228] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L1225: - The smaller, local Gödel holes (pointer failures, needed variables, unclosable tensions) are _instances_ of this underlying structural incompleteness.
- L1226: - Whenever a subject encounters an unresolvable difference, they are encountering a local echo of the deep Gödel hole at the foundation ("change is eternal/unfounded").

### 3. Is "Change as Eternal" Knowable/Provable?
[L1229-L1236] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L1235: - Thus, "change as eternal" is not a fact within the system, but a boundary condition of any system--a Gödel hole that can be mapped, but never closed.

### 4. Consequences for Reality, Science, and Ontology
[L1237-L1241] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L1238: - Any scientific or ontological system will always have its own Gödel holes--local or global--where new structure or knowledge must emerge.

### A. Variable Set Size and "Resolution"
[L1477-L1481] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### B. Gödel Holes and Complexity
[L1482-L1487] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L1484: - _The "smaller" the base unit (higher the variable count, finer the resolution), the more "open" the system is to Gödel holes about its own higher-level behavior._
- L1486: - Thus, physics "contains" Gödel holes about chemistry and biology that cannot be closed from "within" the physics-level variable set.

### C. Lower-Resolution Theories "Encode" Some Holes as Structure
[L1488-L1491] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L1490: - Biology encodes entire regions of "uncomputable" micro-detail as structural givens (cell types, regulatory networks), thereby avoiding many Gödel holes about individual atoms/molecules--but at the cost of having its own holes at higher levels (emergence of mind, evolution, etc.).

### D. Formal Consequence
[L1492-L1499] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=1
- L1493: - As the "base unit" shrinks (physics → chemistry → biology), the system's own variable set "opens" new Gödel holes regarding the predictability and reducibility of higher-level phenomena.
- L1498: Each has Gödel holes corresponding to the phenomena and predictions that its variable set structurally cannot encode.

[L1519-L1525] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L1520: - A theory's "performance" (predictive power, closure, robustness) is structurally linked to its variable granularity and the "density" of its Gödel holes.
- L1524: - The higher the variable count (smaller base), the denser the lattice of Gödel holes about macro-level phenomena.

## 5. Practical, Objective Consequence
[L1526-L1529] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L1528: - "Objective facts" (e.g., limits of prediction in physics for biology) are the externalized, collective form of subject-level Gödel holes.

##### [USER]
[L2507-L2508] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1
- L2508: how does this relate to gödel hole traversal of the meta space the creature is in and the creatures space itself?

###### [AI]
[L2509-L2511] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=1

## 1. Gödel Holes as Constraints on Traversal and Adaptation
[L2512-L2517] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L2513: - Gödel holes are _regions of the metaspace that cannot be entered, computed, or resolved_ by any possible path within the current rules/system--absolute "forbidden zones" or "blind spots."
- L2515: - The shape and location of Gödel holes define what is accessible, expressible, or knowable for that creature.

## 2. The Relationship Between the Metaspace and the Creature's Own Internal Space
[L2518-L2518] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### A. Metaspace Holes (Gödel) vs. Creature's State Space
[L2519-L2523] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L2520: - Metaspace Gödel holes are "global"--they reflect the structure of the entire possibility field, given all possible moves, rules, and unfoldings.

### B. Traversal: When the Creature Encounters (or Fails to Encounter) Gödel Holes
[L2524-L2531] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L2526: - Approach Gödel boundaries--regions where, despite all efforts, further movement or adaptation is impossible (paradox, undecidability, infinite regress, or structural dead-end).
- L2530: - _Example:_ In a formal system, Gödel holes are unprovable truths; in a biological system, they might be unreachable ecological strategies or forms.

## 3. How Traversal Affects Meta-Evolution and Robustness
[L2532-L2541] labels=0 flags=4 paragraphs=0
- L2534: - As the creature adapts or mutates, it may "press against" different parts of the Gödel boundary.
- L2538: - The _shape and density of Gödel holes in the metaspace_ influence which meta-patterns or attractors are possible for the creature.
- L2539: - A system whose local space is "densely perforated" by Gödel holes is more fragile, with fewer robust meta-stable strategies.
- L2540: - A system whose local space is "well-separated" from Gödel holes, or that can re-map its own space to avoid them, is more robust and flexible.

## 4. Implications for Predictability, Survival, and Metastability
[L2542-L2548] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=0
- L2544: - How _close_ its meta-dynamics run to Gödel holes,
- L2547: - Predictability is lost at Gödel boundaries-- meta-prediction can only operate in the traversable regions.

## 5. Analogy to the Mandelbrot Set
[L2549-L2552] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1
- L2551: creatures exploring this "landscape" would find vast stable basins, fractal boundaries, and untraversable gaps--mirroring the Gödel holes of the metaspace.

## 6. Summary:
[L2553-L2562] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=8
- L2555: > The meta-landscape the creature inhabits is globally perforated by Gödel holes--absolute limits on computation, knowledge, or traversal.
- L2562: Otherwise, this is the maximally rigorous answer on Gödel hole traversal in meta and local spaces.

##### [USER]
[L2563-L2564] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1
- L2564: could we say that for this example if specied b somehow survives the likelihood that it overcame a spevific gödelhole innits path by creating a new variable to do so that then for future actions made it more stable then a.

###### [AI]
[L2565-L2567] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=1

## 1. Yes, This Is a Legitimate, Non-Circular Use of Gödel Pressure in Evolutionary Meta-Prediction
[L2568-L2572] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=2
- L2571: then the most plausible cause is that B encountered a Gödel hole in its traversal--and responded by generating a _new variable_ or _new meta-adaptation_ that enabled escape or new robustness.

## 2. Mechanism: Gödel Hole Pressure Forces Innovation
[L2573-L2582] labels=0 flags=3 paragraphs=0
- L2576: - Prediction: A's landscape is "thicker" (more robust, fewer Gödel holes), so A should dominate.
- L2578: - _Key inference:_ B must have encountered a Gödel hole (dead-end, undecidable barrier) in its own (or shared) region.
- L2580: - The _pressure_ of the Gödel hole (structural dead-end) either forced, or created an "opportunity," for B to invent a new variable, new dimension, or meta-move--escaping the dead-end and re-mapping the local space.

## 3. What This Tells You (and How to Audit It)
[L2583-L2591] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=3
- L2585: 1.

## 4. General Rule (Change Ontology):
[L2592-L2596] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=3
- L2594: > the first place to look is at meta-level adaptation triggered by traversal pressure--most often, the presence of a Gödel hole.

## 5. Meta-Competitive Advantage and Innovation
[L2597-L2602] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1
- L2598: - A system (species, agent, algorithm) that can "feel" or respond to Gödel holes (meta-level dead-ends) with innovation is not just surviving by chance;

## 6. Rigorous Audit Protocol
[L2603-L2611] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L2606: - 3.

## Summary Principle
[L2612-L2619] labels=0 flags=2 paragraphs=6
- L2613: > Unexpected survival (or dominance) in the face of naive disadvantage is most rigorously explained by meta-level innovation under Gödel hole pressure.
- L2619: Your reasoning is sound and can be formalized--Gödel hole-driven innovation is a real, structural cause of meta-competitive advantage in change-based systems.

### A. Relative to Classical Science, Mathematics, and Systems Theory:
[L3067-L3077] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1
- L3070: - _Classical models_ (Markov, probability, ODEs, game theory, etc.) are bound to fixed rule spaces, fixed variable sets, and treat innovation or collapse as "noise," "random shock," or "externality."

### B. Compared to Contemporary "Complexity Science" or "Emergence" Talk:
[L3078-L3087] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=1
- L3086: - Turns "creative pressure" (Gödel hole pressure) into an auditable, causal property.

### C. Compared to Philosophy of Science, Computation, and Logic:

- L3709: yes thats functionally the same as we already know from classical models what i am asking is does chang eontology with its non classical naturee allow us to predivt not what attractor is formed but rather if attractoes form or not based on gödel holes?

###### [AI]

## Can Change Ontology (via Gödel Holes) Predict _Whether_ Attractors Form, Without Predicting Which?
[L3713-L3714] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

### 1. Short Answer
[L3715-L3717] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L3716: - Change ontology does not let you _in general_ predict whether attractors will form (for arbitrary systems) by prior reasoning--_even_ if you incorporate Gödel holes as structural elements.

### 2. Gödel Holes and Attractor Formation
[L3718-L3718] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

#### A. What Are Gödel Holes in This Context?
[L3719-L3721] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L3720: - Gödel holes = _Structurally unreachable, undecidable, or forbidden regions of the possibility field_ (i.e., "you can't get there, and you can't even prove whether you can or not").

#### B. Relation to Attractors
[L3722-L3725] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L3723: - If you can _prove_ a region of the field is a Gödel hole (unreachable/undecidable), you can exclude it from being an attractor.

### 3. What Change Ontology Allows--Nonclassical Insight
[L3726-L3726] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

#### A. Local, Not Global
[L3727-L3732] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L3732: - _There is no non-classical "Gödel hole detector" that reliably tells you "no attractor will form" before audit._

#### B. Structural, Not Algorithmic
[L3733-L3736] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=0

#### C. Creative Pressure and Attractors
[L3737-L3741] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L3739: - _It lets you see "creative Gödel pressure"_--that is, when a trajectory is forced to innovate or "meta-jump" to avoid a hole or dead end.

### 4. Concrete Principle
[L3742-L3748] labels=0 flags=0 paragraphs=2

### 5. Special Cases (for Clarity)
[L3749-L3752] labels=0 flags=1 paragraphs=0
- L3750: - If the system is _provably_ filled with Gödel holes (everywhere unreachable), then _no attractors form_--but such systems are contrived and rare.

## Final Assessment
[L3753-L3759] labels=0 flags=3 paragraphs=5
- L3754: > Change ontology does not "solve" attractor prediction via Gödel holes--it formalizes and illuminates _why_ such prediction is structurally limited and only possible by empirical mapping.
- L3756: > If you can explicitly map Gödel holes, you can rule out attractors there.
- L3758: If you want an explicit protocol for detecting Gödel holes or auditing for attractors, specify.
