# Actor — selective recursion with memory
## Claim (formal)
An actor is a recursive field that selects incoming change trajectories, commits to a subset of them, and records the selection in memory traces. It chooses via pointer-weighted reach relations, stores the choices via memory-trace integration, and constrains future recursion through breath-mediated stabilization.

## Philosophical translation
An actor is not merely a thinker or a body: it is the loop that chooses what to keep, what to discard, and what to revisit, using previous recursions as context. Its identity depends on the selective recursion that composes A–makes choices–relies on remembered paths to guide future iterations.

## Justification
- From [[S-DF-pointer-structural]] and [[S-DF-localreach-topology]], every new “now” implies a minimal elsewhere and a possible reach graph; the actor uses these pointers to prefer certain directions.
- [[S-DF-memory-trace-integration]] supplies the traces that keep choices coherent, letting the recursion be “selective” instead of random.
- Selective recursion with memory creates the structural scaffolding for decision, intentionality, and the breath loops that underpin the actor’s narrative continuity.

## Implication
Actors are the operative units that instantiate consciousness, meaning, and communication by weaving pointer/life traces with stabilized recursion. Modeling actor behavior requires both the pointer map and the memory traces that feed selective recursion.
