# Foundational texts must label every operator and dependency

Every foundational document (FND_0…FND_6) must introduce its primitives, thresholds, and operators via labeled blocks (`DF x.y`, `CR x.y`, `FT x.y`). Symbols such as `Reach`, `Δ`, `C`, `↶`, `⇘`, and any continuity/graph claims must be tied to a formal entry that states scope, properties, and any continuity bounds. Unlabeled prose breaks the traceability chain, so downstream files cannot cite or verify entailments without a label. The moment a concept appears without a label, it is either (a) promoted into a labeled derivation or (b) locally framed as a gauge note and treated as representational convenience.
