# The metaspace of change is a fractal, perforated, tension-driven field

The metaspace of change is not a smooth Euclidean space but a fractal, perforated field where every region is a temporary closure bordered by Gödel holes. Stability exists only on these boundary edges; any classical attempt to totalize the space collapses under new holes. Directionality is given by gradients of tension/exposure—following those pressure lines is how the system mutates—and every new operator or frame warps the local metric, making coordinates emergent rather than fixed. This insight, articulated in AI_13 lines 1380‑1480, describes the shape of change as a living, recursive network of holes rather than a static territory.
