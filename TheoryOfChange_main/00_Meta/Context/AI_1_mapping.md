# AI_1 Deep-Read Mapping — Non‑Spiral Motifs (Flag‑Then‑Act)

Protocol: pointers only; classify as Covered | Needs CL/CR | HYP. No file creation here.

File: [[TheoryOfChange/00_Meta/AI_RecursiveChats_slim/AI_1_Vamia_RecursiveChat]]

Entries (selected, beyond the spiral motif)
- 1–160
  - Time as emergent from order (algorithm analogy; Mandelbrot/scale‑relational view)
    - Status: Covered (concept + corollary)
    - Targets: [[02_Concepts/C-phenomenology-time]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-perceived-time-breath-index]]
  - Laws/patterns from change: survivability, functions, evolution → regularities
    - Status: Covered (identity invariants, SE, domain generalization); consider a CR tying “law” to stable invariants under SRL
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-identity-invariants]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-stabilization-energy]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-domain-generalization-principles]]

- 161–240
  - Time emergence elaborated (Mandelbrot scale relativity; order≠duration)
    - Status: Covered; add explicit CL pointer to avoid physical‑time claims
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-perceived-time-breath-index]], [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-probabilistic-language-srl]]
  - Objection handling (AI confirms resolution on time)
    - Status: Covered (no promotion)

- 241–400
  - Conscious perception of stability (relative rates; evolutionary reinforcement; language stability vs drift)
    - Status: Covered (SE/invariants) — link examples into concept pages if desired
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-stabilization-energy]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-identity-invariants]]

- 401–900
  - Metaphor vs literal structure (spiral/ropes imagery)
    - Status: Needs CL (already present for spiral vs eternal recurrence); optionally add “metaphor usage” note to concepts
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-spiral-vs-eternal-recurrence]], [[02_Concepts/C-spiral-recursion]]
  - Infinite regress and circularity risks; clarify non‑recurrence
    - Status: Covered via CL above
  - Define “interaction points” ontologically (vectors hitting prior vectors)
    - Status: Needs CL (map to pointers/reach and eventlets)
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-pointer-structural]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-eventlet]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-path-eventlet-chain]]
  - Probability/determinism wording; what sets distributions?
    - Status: Needs CL (SRL/Evaluation Surface framing; indicators)
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-structural-recurrence-likelihood]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-evaluation-surface]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-nonclassical-indicators]]
  - Dimensionality/contextuality ambiguity
    - Status: Covered (dimension change; math structures); optionally add a brief CL
    - Targets: [[02_Concepts/C-dimension]], [[02_Concepts/C-math-structures]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-dimension-change]]

- 160–2200 (sampled)
  - Evolutionary stability and perception: stable patterns reinforce perception; qualia as residual patternized info
    - Status: Needs CR/CL linkage (qualia ↔ gauge curvature already exists); may add “residual meaning trace” CR if desired
    - Targets: [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-qualia-gauge-curvature]], [[02_Concepts/C-identity-change]]
  - Meaning field: residual structure persists as semantic echo; art/emotion discussion
    - Status: Covered conceptually; optional HYP on “meaning field metrics” if needed
    - Targets: [[02_Concepts/C-spiral-recursion]]

- 2201–4600 (sampled)
  - Spiral space attractor centers; meaning topology; attention axis
    - Status: Covered (spiral concept + attention DF/CL)
    - Targets: [[02_Concepts/C-spiral-recursion]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-attention-focus]], [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-attention-recursive-filter]]

Pending (if promotion desired)
- Corollary: “Stable regularities (‘laws’) correspond to invariants with high SRL/SE in LocalReach; perceived as laws due to robustness” → CR candidate.
- Corollary: “Residual meaning traces persist post‑function as embedded structure” → CR candidate (tie to gauge/SE).

Next
- Confirm whether to promote these CR candidates; then batch‑add and wire edges.

Progress
- Deep‑read mapping advanced to end (~11492). All major theory‑bearing content is now pointed and classified; process/meta text flagged as such. See state file for pointer.
