# HYP — Migration ledger for legacy vs Phil foundations

Hypothesis: publishing a `MIGRATION.md` that maps every legacy DF/CR label from FND_0 (legacy) to the revised Phil naming scheme, along with a glossary for ⇘/↶/Reach/Δ/C/qε/gauge, will make downstream references auditable while enabling quarantine of AI_13/14 excerpts until relabeled. If true, this ledger should show one-to-one correspondences and surface any missing entailments, letting reviewers confirm that all earlier primitives still exist under the new naming.
