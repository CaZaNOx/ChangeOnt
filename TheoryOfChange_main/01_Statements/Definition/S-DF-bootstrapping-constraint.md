# Bootstrapping constraint — build only from secured structure
## Claim (formal)
Add structure only when forced by prior secured results (performative/derivational), logging GH otherwise; avoid importing unearned primitives.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
We build carefully: no bricks that the wall can’t already support.
