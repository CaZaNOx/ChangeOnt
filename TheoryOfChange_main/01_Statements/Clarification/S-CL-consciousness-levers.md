# Consciousness tests should manipulate urgency, broadcast, reflex, time-kernel, and plasticity

Operationalize consciousness by designing experiments that ablate or modulate five levers: urgency (g_U), global broadcast (B), reflexive access (D_A), time-kernel memory (τ), and plasticity (λ). Change Ontology predicts that altering these knobs shifts phenomenology and performance under drift; lacking those effects falsifies the theory. Layout a change-ontology-native Turing test where deforming these operators provokes measurable collapse/insight shifts, as AI_13 outlines in lines 16387‑16460.
