# Awareness — subject’s being aware of something
## Claim (formal)
Awareness := relation in which a subject is aware of some content.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
“Awareness” is the being-aware relation between a subject and something. It is intrinsically about—awareness is directed toward content; it is not a content-free glow.

## Philosophical Justification
“Awareness” without a subject or without content is empty; the term loses its sense absent both relata. This is the minimal intentionality claim: awareness is of something, for someone. It resists the temptation to reify awareness as a substance on its own; instead, it clarifies the structural relation at the base of experience.

## Explanation (informal)
Fixes the triadic structure: subject — awareness — something.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- Co‑defined with subject and experience; none is prior in isolation.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Awareness(S, X) := Subject(S) ∧ Experience(X) ∧ AwareOf(S, X)
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- proof: definitional; see [[S-DF-subject]] and [[S-DF-experience]].

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Triad is mutually constitutive; not a circular definition but a co‑definition.
- Related symbols: [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]] (used in experiential grounding)

## Next Steps in Chain
- suggest: formalize measurement predicates for AwareOf(S, X).
