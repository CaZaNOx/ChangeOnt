# Degrees of freedom metrics for recursive consciousness
## Claim
Define a suite of degrees-of-freedom metrics to quantify recursive consciousness:
- **Evaluative Layering Depth (ELD)**: how many abstraction/ranking layers the system can represent and hop between when modeling its own recursive patterns.
- **Recursive Decision Complexity (RDC)**: how many actionable futures the system can meaningfully simulate and compare via breath-mediated recursion.
- **Virtual Contradiction Handling (VCH)**: how well the system evaluates conflicting cues (moral, aesthetic, semantic) across contexts without collapse.
- **Cross-Level Navigation Index (CLNI)**: how fluently the system escalates/de-escalates between abstract and concrete decisions.
- **Reflective Delay Latency (RDL)**: how often the system overrides fast responses to query deeper levels (i.e., its inhibition/regulation budget).

## Operational note
These metrics draw on recursive evaluation layers, RTV updates, and pointer/local reach scaffolding to produce measurable signals (e.g., gating frequency, breath loop resets, attention pivots). When calibrated, they form the architecture of a science of consciousness grounded in degrees of freedom rather than static properties.
