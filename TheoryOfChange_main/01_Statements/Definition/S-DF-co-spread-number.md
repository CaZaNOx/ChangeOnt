# CO spread number — central value plus breadth and depth

A change-native quantity is encoded as a three-tuple `x = (μ, b, d)` where `μ` reports the forced scalar value, `b` records the breadth of alternative continuations that remain plausible, and `d` captures how finely the representation pins down the phenomenon. Ordering on spreads is component-wise (`x ⪯ y` iff `μₓ ≤ μ_y`, `bₓ ≤ b_y`, `dₓ ≤ d_y`).

Addition is Minkowski-like: combining two spreads stacks their central values and accumulates breadth/depth uncertainty (`x ⊞ y = (μ_x+μ_y, b_x+b_y, d_x+d_y)`). Multiplication propagates first-order sensitivity: `x ⊠ y = (μ_x μ_y, |μ_x| b_y + |μ_y| b_x + b_x b_y, |μ_x| d_y + |μ_y| d_x + d_x d_y)`. Residuation finds the tightest spread `h` such that `x ⊠ h ⪯ z`, honoring non-cancellative propagation.

Setting `b=d=0` recovers the classical semiring because spreads collapse to points, so the `x ↦ (x,0,0)` embedding is a semiring monomorphism. Spreads are not rings: additive inverses would reintroduce cancellation, which would lose the robustness captured by the breadth/depth dimensions.
