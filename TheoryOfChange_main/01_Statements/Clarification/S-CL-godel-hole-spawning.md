# New layers are born from Gödel-hole resolutions, not smooth extensions

Every major meta-layer jump (chemistry→biology, biology→mind/memes, potentially physics→higher universes) is anchored in a Gödel hole: a structural contradiction that cannot be resolved within the prior layer except by spawning a radically new logic. The emergent layer need not resemble its parent—it may invert, oppose, or recombine earlier rules while inheriting trace signatures—and it appears only when option density and contradiction pressure reach a critical threshold. This framing keeps the ontology falsifiable (you must detect the hole) while allowing a generative model for universes born from higher-order contradictions, even though cosmological evidence is still missing.
