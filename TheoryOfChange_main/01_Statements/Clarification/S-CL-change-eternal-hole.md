# Change as eternal is the master Gödel hole driving emergence

In your ontology, "change as eternal" is not a theorem but the universal Gödel hole: an ever-present, unclosable prior that every attempt at derivation hits. Local Gödel holes (pointer failures, required new variables) are echoes of that deep structural boundary. Mapping them reveals where emergence, mutation, and the need for new structure arise—every classical or scientific system is haunted by this background hole, which is the engine of creativity and novelty. AI_13 lines 1215‑1255 confirm that you cannot find a first change, only ever-escaping pointers, so the eternal change itself must be treated as the meta-Gödel hole.
