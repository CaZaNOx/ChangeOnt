# Time and pattern/noise thresholds as emergent reach phenomena
## Content
Both time and the difference between pattern and noise are emergent consequences of recursive change rather than extra assumptions.
- **Time** arises from updating LocalReach/Depth structures: each breath cycle and pointer update defines a new “now,” so "before" and "after" are relative orders within recursive reach, not absolutes. The minimal time resolution corresponds to the granularity at which pointer-local reach can distinguish successive pattern instantiations (see [[S-DF-depth-reach]] and [[S-DF-localreach-topology]]). Temporal asymmetry follows from breath-driven stabilization energy, not an external clock.
- **Pattern vs. noise** is governed by the same thresholds that make consciousness claims valid: a pattern must support enduring SE and pointer coherence, weaving through LocalReach neighborhoods without collapsing into drift (see [[S-CL-consciousness-thresholds]], [[S-CL-operational-change-minimal-axiom]]). False positives are naturally penalized when pointer-induced reach fails to converge or when SE drops below stability floors, thus realizing the “pattern-recognition cost function” the chat demanded.

## Implication
This clarifies why we do not need extra axioms for time or for seeing patterns: both follow from Δ(Now) plus the reach/threshold infrastructure. Understanding them as emergent reach phenomena also gives a clear handle on how to tune thresholds (hard, soft, or context-sensitive) via SE, LocalReach, and breath-phase control.
