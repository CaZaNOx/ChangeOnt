# Δ — Difference / tension

Definition (formal):
Minimal non-emptiness of distinction. For any observation O, there exists Δ(O) ≠ 0.

Explanation:
Field-level difference structuring all subsequent modulations (identity, locality, subjectivity).

## Math
```math
\exists O:\; \Delta(O) \ne 0 \;\; \Rightarrow \; \Delta \ne \varnothing
```
Interpreted as the existence of at least one discriminable distinction in any observation.

## Example
- Used in stmt.immediate-datum (Δ ≠ ∅)
- Appears in derivations of continuity and non-cessation.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
In any act of noticing, there is some difference; reality is never completely undifferentiated.

## Philosophical Justification
Denying difference requires performing a differentiating act (a performative contradiction). Thus Δ expresses the most elementary condition of intelligibility.

## Explanation (informal)
Δ is the field-level “something changed” that all other constructs (identity, subject, locality) modulate and refine.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Δ is ontological non‑emptiness, not merely a metric difference.
- Δ and δ co-exist: δ captures local/minimal shifts; Δ names the global condition of difference.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Link Δ to identity formation (self-similarity under change).
- Connect Δ to measurement protocols (thresholds ε, σ(ε)).
