# Collapse-induced threshold shifts and pointer-span metrics expose frame shifts

Track `Δ_min` shifts by measuring the smallest series of differences for which the subject can again point to a prior after a collapse/pointer overload. Record the frequency, timing, and conditions of subject-structure shifts (frame shifts) via metrics such as "collapse-induced threshold shifts," "pointer span depth," and the tension at collapse. These metrics reveal how the ontology's own structure changes rather than importing external thresholds—aligning with the non-classical ledger described in AI_13 lines 700‑708.
