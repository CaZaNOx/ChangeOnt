# Element — EC — Identity (closure and tracking)
## Claim (formal)
Maintain identity_ok by applying ReID kernel under ε‑closure; emit last_distance and eps_used to support stable class operations.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Keep track of what stays the same, even when it changes a bit.

## Philosophical Justification
Identity is not a guess; it is an auditable claim under declared similarity and closure. ReID kernels evaluate cross‑time sameness under gauge transport; ε‑closure collapses near‑duplicates into classes, ensuring operations act on kinds rather than fragile instances. This makes identity persistence explicit and inspectable across gaps, aligning with the identity‑through‑change program.

## Derivation (Formal/Operational)
```text
identity_ok := K_reid(x_t, x_s; Γ, ε) ≥ θ over window K
class := [x]_≈ε      # quotient under ε-identity
```
Outputs include last_distance and eps_used to explain decisions.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Identity criteria and ε must be declared per domain and tracked over time.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Integrate with closure operators (OPS/J2) and tracking across occlusions.
