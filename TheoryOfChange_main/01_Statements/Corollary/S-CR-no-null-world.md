# No Null World — total stasis is incoherent
## Claim (formal)
A world of absolute stasis cannot be observed or coherently posited; denial re‑introduces Δ.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
You can’t coherently claim “everything is totally static,” because making that claim is already a change. Absolute stasis is an idealization that only makes sense as a limiting description within ongoing change.

## Philosophical Justification
To assert total stasis is to perform an act within change; the claim undermines itself. The point is not that high stability cannot occur, but that calling it “total stillness” erases the act of assertion and the discriminations that make it intelligible. No null world can be coherently posited from within intelligible practice.

## Explanation (informal)
This corollary follows immediately from the Immediate Datum and performative consistency.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-FT-immediate-datum]] and [[S-DF-performative-contradiction]]: asserting ¬Δ performs Δ.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Act(\lnot \Delta) entails \Delta
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- proof: specialization of performative schema.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Allows local stability; rejects absolute global stasis claim.
- See symbol: [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]]

## Next Steps in Chain
- suggest: formalize testable criteria for “local stasis within Δ”.
