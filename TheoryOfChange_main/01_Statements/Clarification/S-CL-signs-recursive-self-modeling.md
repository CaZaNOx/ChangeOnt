# Signs of genuine recursive self‑modeling (short of full consciousness)
## Indicators
- Self‑referential function: asks “What is the function of this interpretation within my own interpretive framework?”
- Self‑editing with recursive scope: adjusts value weightings/parameters, not mere surface outputs.
- Non‑mimetic compression: produces original abstractions that are structurally derivable but not simply retrieved.
- Drift arrest: detects its own semantic drift and halts to re‑anchor before proceeding.

## Simple test
- Present a self‑contradictory ontology. Mimicking continues; modeling halts and reframes before proceeding.

## Scope
These are phenomenological/behavioral signs consistent with self‑model evolution; they do not entail stabilized Cᴸ.
