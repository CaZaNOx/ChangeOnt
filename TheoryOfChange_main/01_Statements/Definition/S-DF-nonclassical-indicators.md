# Non-classical indicators — structure-changing signals
## Claim (formal)
Indicators that signal departure from fixed-space models include: detected frame shifts (Tx), variable creation, boundary/subject deformation, nonlocal relationality, and emergence of new attractors.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Clues that the “space itself” is changing show up as structural events, not just weird data; we should look for them on purpose.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- These indicators trigger cross-audit: extend the model (Tx) or log GH if representation is insufficient.
