# The metaspace of change is infinitely perforated by Gödel holes

Every frame, paradigm, or subject-field is surrounded by Gödel holes—structural sites where current tools cannot explain, close, or ground new differences. You cannot ever map the entire metaspace because every location contains unresolved holes and the space itself can never be fully enumerated. This is the perforated, self-modifying metaspace AI_13 describes in lines 1368‑1378; mapping and logging the holes is the only way to know where mutation will be forced next.
