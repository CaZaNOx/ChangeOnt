# Entropy (Σ) in Change Ontology
## Claim (formal)
Σ measures diversity/variety of return paths/configurations under breath, complementing stability (SE) and identity criteria (≈, invariants).

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
It tells how many different “ways back” a pattern has as the world breathes.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Operational note (estimation): when estimating Σ from a discrete distribution q, normalize q to probabilities and guard small values to avoid log(0), e.g., p_i = max(ε, q_i/∑q) with small ε; then Σ ≈ −∑_i p_i log p_i. This does not change the concept; it prevents numerical artifacts in practice.
