# LocalReach(Now) — induced topology from Reach
## Claim (formal)
Given Reach as a transitive relation, define for each x the neighborhood \(\mathcal{N}(x) := \{ y\ |\ Reach(y, x)\}\). The collection {\(\mathcal{N}(x)\)} induces a pretopology; with symmetry or additional axioms, a topology on the reachable set.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
“Near the now” means: can be reached by change. Those reachable points form the basic neighborhoods that let us talk about continuity and stability without reifying a time axis.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Pretopological base allows us to discuss continuity of patterns and operators (including Tx) within LocalReach.

## Derivation (Formal)
```text
Base neighborhoods:  B_x := { N ⊆ LocalReach | x ∈ N ∧ ∀y∈N: Reach(y,x) }.
Continuity of F: LocalReach → LocalReach if F^{-1}(N)∈B_x for all N∈B_{F(x)}.
```
