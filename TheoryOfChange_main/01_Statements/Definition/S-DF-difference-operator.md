# Difference operator diff(x,y) — discriminability predicate
## Claim (formal)
diff(x,y) ≠ ∅ denotes discriminable difference between abstract points x and y; diff(x,y) = ∅ denotes no discriminable difference. Aligned with similarity (≈) and identity criteria.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
To say two things differ is to say change presents them as not the same in a way we can pick up.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Interoperates with ≈ by stating when small differences remain within identity tolerance.
