# Keep receipt counts and verbatim quotes with each audit

Every audit of a prior AI must record the number of quoted slices and show the verbatim text that triggered the judgement, as AI_18 instructs. Without this discipline, claims of progress or compliance may simply be rhetorical. The receipt log should include file names, line numbers, and the quoted excerpt, plus the running total across the chat.
