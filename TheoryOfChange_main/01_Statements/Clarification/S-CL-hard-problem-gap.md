# Change ontology cannot yet deduce subjectivity from structure alone

The hard problem—why a recursive, tension-modulating change field amounts to subjective experience—remains an open gap. A fully specified Change Ontology model can show that something must happen at the Gödelian hole, but no structural account, however rich, logically entails that “what happens” is characterized by presence-for-itself rather than another kind of pattern. Any claim to solve the gap without a new principle collapses into re-labeling or epistemic humility. Change ontology can map and tighten the bridge, but it cannot deduce subjectivity unless it derives a new principle that collapses any denial into inconsistency, as AI_13 argues in lines 13878‑13950.
