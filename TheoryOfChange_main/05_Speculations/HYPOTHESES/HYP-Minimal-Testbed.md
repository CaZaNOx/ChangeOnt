# Hypothesis — Minimal testbed for recursive stabilization
Proposal
- Build a toy environment with breath cycles, local pointers, and adjustable σ(ε); track RTV locks, SE trends, and identity persistence.

Measures
- Lock duration/frequency, SRL, SE variance; collapse regime classification.
 - Drift induction protocol: vary σ(ε) and apply Tx perturbations; record DC, Γ curvature/strain, SE drops; compare pre/post identity markers (≈, invariants).
