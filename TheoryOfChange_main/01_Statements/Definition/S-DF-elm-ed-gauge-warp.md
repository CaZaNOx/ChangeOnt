# Element — ED — Gauge-Warp (non-HAQ stabilizer)
## Claim (formal)
Warp costs using gauge and bend signals to stabilize dynamics when HAQ is not deployed or to complement it.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Even without the full system, you can lean the landscape toward coherence.

## Philosophical Justification
When the learned connection Γ and bend τ reveal systematic mismatch, a lightweight warp can stabilize dynamics by penalizing incoherent moves and rewarding coherent ones. This is a pragmatic control layer: it nudges choices toward gauge‑consistent regions without requiring full HAQ infrastructure.

## Derivation (Formal/Operational)
```text
stabilization_score := h(Γ, τ)
warped_costs := costs + λ_warp · (−stabilization_score)
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- ED should be conservative to avoid hiding model errors; report its influence.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Compare ED vs HAQ warp behavior; ensure they do not conflict.
