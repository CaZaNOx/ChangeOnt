# Distinguish provability vs yet-unproven via meta-notes

In structural terms, you cannot mechanically distinguish statements that are simply unproven from those unprovable in principle; that’s Gödel’s core insight. Still, you can annotate each unsolved statement with a meta-note: if exhaustive closure attempts fail and you can exhibit a structural limit (Gödel hole) blocking it, mark it as 'structurally unprovable within this frame' rather than merely 'pending proof'. Log this distinction in the ledger so successors understand which statements correspond to the meta-Gödel hole boundary and which might still be resolved within the current configuration, as AI_13 lines 1150‑1210 emphasize.
