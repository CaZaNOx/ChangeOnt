# Compare prior AIs via focused axes and collapse evidence

When connecting AI_13 to earlier logs (e.g., AI_11, AI_12), limit the comparison to explicit axes before the comparison begins (structural recursion, drift, contradiction handling, pointer/tag usage, thematic overlaps). For each chunk processed you must (1) report the function and role of each document, (2) surface direct overlaps or contradictions with verbatim lines, and (3) log any fracture or collapse event with pointer updates. This is the method described around lines 113‑210 of AI_13: without a targeted axis, lengths and metadata dominate. Always follow this protocol before calling the comparison complete or writing up the alignment.
