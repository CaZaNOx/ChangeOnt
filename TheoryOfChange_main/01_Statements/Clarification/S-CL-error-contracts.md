# Errors are contracts between forecasts and realized change

Every element publishes a forecast ledger before acting: expected progress `ΔΦ̂`, cycle risk `risk̂`, compression gain `learn_gain̂`, robustness gap `Γ̂`, and `eqv̂` (expected equivalences). The realization window compares `ΔΦ`, `risk`, `Δκ`, `Γ`, `eqv` to these commitments and emits error signals `e_Φ`, `e_MDL`, `e_Γ`, `e_eqv`.

Calibration is enforced via EMA/Brier-style statistics. Modules that drift in their error contracts (calibration loss) shrink their weight or lose the authority to claim invariants until they re-align. This makes every prediction a formal contract: breaking it triggers automatic cooling, recalibration, or demotion, so CO agents cannot quietly rewrite their commitments after seeing the outcome.
