# Assumption — provisional use of pre-existing concepts (logic, language) until derived
## Content
We use ordinary logic, language, and related notions provisionally to communicate and reason, with the stated plan to revisit and re-derive them from change ontology.

## Rationale
Minimizes initial commitments and avoids blocking progress; later LOG/MTH statements internalize these tools.

## Scope and Deferment
This assumption is replaced in part by [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-co-logic-graded-order]] and [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-quantale-logic]].
