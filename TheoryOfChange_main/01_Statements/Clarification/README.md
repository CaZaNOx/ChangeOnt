# Clarifications (CL)

Scope
- Definitional scoping and interpretive notes that reduce ambiguity without adding new commitments (e.g., “continuity = non-cessation”, “pointer is structural”).

Conventions
- Frontmatter `type: CL` and links to the DF/FT they clarify.
- Keep short; include “Implication” where it helps readers avoid common misreadings.

Graph policy
- Clarifications are not first-class nodes in the derivation DAG. They are connected via backlinks and concept pages.

Maintenance
- After updates, run `python3 tools/update_backlinks.py` and `python3 tools/validate_toc_main.py`.
