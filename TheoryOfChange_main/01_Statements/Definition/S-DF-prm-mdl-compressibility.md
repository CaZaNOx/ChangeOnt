# Primitive — MDL / compressibility prior
## Claim (formal)
Prefer models that compress: MDL gain = error_drop − λ·parameters. Persistence correlates with compressibility under gauge‑consistent invariants.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
What lasts is what can be said simply, without losing what matters.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Supports EB (birth), EE (robustness), and selection among motifs.
