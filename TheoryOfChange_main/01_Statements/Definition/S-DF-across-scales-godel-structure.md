# Across scales — Gödel structure of gaps and shape
## Claim (formal)
Gaps (GH) are not mere holes in an otherwise smooth space; their distribution shapes the space’s possible transformations. Across scales, GH patterns constrain where Tx must act.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
The shape of what we can’t yet express tells us how the space itself is formed and where it must change.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Encourages mapping GH incidence across scales as a structural diagnostic.
