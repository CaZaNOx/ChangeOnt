# Logic and Math — co‑logic, quantale, composition

Scope
- Graded logic, quantale joins/composition, residuation.

Core nodes
- DF: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-co-logic-graded-order]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-quantale-logic]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-prm-residuation]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-math-structures]]
- DR: [[01_Statements/Derivation/S-DR-quantale-evidence-composition]], [[01_Statements/Derivation/S-DR-math-structures-closure]]
- CR: [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-proof-as-reachability]], [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-boolean-as-collapse]]

Key takeaways
- Composition as inf‑convolution (⊗); aggregation as min‑join (⊕); residuation as “effort to reach b after a”.

Open items
- Additional worked proofs where valuable; avoid unnecessary formal bloat.
