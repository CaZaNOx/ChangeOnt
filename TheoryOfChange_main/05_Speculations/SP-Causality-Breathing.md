# Breathing Causality — causality as phase-coherent survival echo
Summary:
Causality is perceived where Δ‑phase coherence persists across breath cycles; high σ(ε) fractures causality; SE/RTV thresholds bound stability.

Why speculative:
Requires an explicit mapping from RTV fixed points to causal ordering constructs; not fully formalized in LOG/MTH here.

Recommended next step:
Add a CR under RTV formalizing “stable phase ordering implies causal order under breath” and test with simple models.
