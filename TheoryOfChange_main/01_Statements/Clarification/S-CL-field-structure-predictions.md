# Map field tension/holes to predictions across domains

Change ontology lets you turn field structure into concrete forecasts: the spectrum of collapse/stabilization in quantum measurement, early warning of complexity barriers, the timing of innovation jumps, and where attractors will emerge are all functions of measurable field tension, meta-stability, or hole density. Instead of waiting for phase transitions or quotidian surprises, compute or bound when the underlying field must deform, and use those metrics to guide experiments, designs, or evolutionary scenarios. This is the cross-domain promise laid out in the sections on quantum paradoxes, complexity theory, evolutionary innovation, and emergent attractors in AI_13 lines 4390‑4700.
