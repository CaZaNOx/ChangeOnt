# Define a change operator that preserves overlap while introducing new difference

Characterize change as an operator `PropertyChange(X_n)` that produces the next difference-pattern `X_{n+1}` such that `0 < Similarity(X_n, X_{n+1}) < 1`. Similarity is computed purely over the relational differences `R(X)`; the operator must retain at least one existing relation while adding at least one novel one. If total identity or total disjunction occurs, the operator is forced to break stasis by restoring partial overlap. Mapping to automata/categorical analogies ensures no substrate is reintroduced. Avoid classical drift by keeping all relations relational (no named entities) and by preventing external agent intervention, as AI_13 lines 8404‑8660 detail.
