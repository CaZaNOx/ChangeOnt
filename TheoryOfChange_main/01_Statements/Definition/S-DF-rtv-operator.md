# Recursive Truth Value (RTV)
## Claim (formal)
RTV evaluates a claim’s stability across recursive breath cycles under evolving conditions; truth is a fixed point or stable orbit in the validation dynamics.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Under change, we do not test once — we breathe the test. Truth is what keeps validating as the system and its resolution adjust.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- RTV depends on ε, σ(ε), and collapse ⊘ predicates; it complements classical truth with dynamical evaluation.
