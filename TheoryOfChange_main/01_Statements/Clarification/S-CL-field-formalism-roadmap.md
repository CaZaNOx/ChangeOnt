# Formalize the change field, tension, and holes before predicting outcomes

To make the predictive promise real you must spell out the field, cuts, tension, and holes in formal terms: define the configuration space, a change intensity field, the partitions that count as stabilizations, and tension/hole metrics derived from gradients or connectivity. Once these objects exist, derive bounds (“if tension > T then Black Swan rate > R”) and test them in data/simulation. Without this minimal formal roadmap—field definition, tension measure, hole density, predictive constraint—change ontology stays metaphorical. Lines 4800‑5030 give the explicit steps for turning the field narrative into calculable, testable constraints.
