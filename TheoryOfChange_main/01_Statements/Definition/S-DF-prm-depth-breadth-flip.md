# Primitive — Depth/Breadth flip from loopiness and phase
## Claim (formal)
Compute a policy p_breadth = f(loopiness, phase) that flips exploration/exploitation based on recurrence propensity and breath phase. High short‑cycle propensity and specific phases increase breadth; otherwise prioritize depth along stable trajectories.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
When the system is circling, widen the search; when it flows, go deeper.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Couples to ELM‑EH (breadth/depth scheduling) and attention routing.
- Avoids lock‑in and collapse by syncing policy with global integrator dynamics (breath).
