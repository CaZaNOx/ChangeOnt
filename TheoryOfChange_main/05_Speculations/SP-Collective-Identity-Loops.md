# Collective Identity Loops — phase-synchronized identity ecosystems
Summary:
Multiple identity loops can synchronize via shared gauge, amplifying SE and risking cascade collapse.

Why speculative:
Needs coupling model and stability analysis under intersubject gauge; not formalized here.

Recommended next step:
Add CR under intersubject gauge about cross‑SE amplification and collapse propagation; support with simple coupling models.
