# Coupled subjects — cross‑SE amplification and cascade risk under intersubject gauge
## Statement (corollary)
When subjects are coupled by the inter‑subject gauge, alignment reduces pairwise misfit and can raise effective stabilization energy (SE) for shared structures; conversely, strong misalignment can propagate collapse by lowering SE across the coupled set.

## Justification from definitions
- From [[S-DF-intersubject-gauge]]: shared alignment minimizes misfit between coupled subjects’ percepts/costs.
- From [[S-DF-stabilization-energy]]: higher SE supports persistence; reduced SE increases fragility.
Combining the two, alignment acts as a stabilizer on shared loops (SE↑), while misfit acts as a destabilizer (SE↓) that can spread via the coupling.
