# OPS discovery pipeline — invariant extraction + validation

To keep headers grounded in empirical shape, CO runs the following pipeline for every new task:
1. Normalize logs (time, breath, gauge) and temporarily disable the adaptive gauge (`τ→0`, `A=0`) to expose the classical slice candidate.
2. Fit a world model `M_T` for the task (maze graph, bandit arm family, renewal law) and extract invariants `I_T` such as graph metrics, KL gaps, or hazard tails.
3. Enforce refinement and gauge invariance on `I_T`; invariants must persist across ε- and h-sweeps.
4. Check the classical gate (`H≈0`, performance ≈ baseline). Only if the gate passes do we trust invariants as objective. Otherwise we attribute deviations to change-native holonomy and keep them tagged as header metadata.
5. Run ablations (remove gauges, disable adaptive knobs) to ensure invariants remain stable; log results in the OPS card with confidence bands.

Passed OPS cards include invariants with confidence intervals, ablation tables, and the slice flag. This pipeline both discovers new OSS (Objective Shape Signatures) and prevents smuggling classical claims into CO stories.
