# Transformation Operator (Tx) — frame-level change
## Claim (formal)
Tx acts on the configuration of the subject/space itself (frame), not merely on states within a fixed frame. Tx: (S, Frame) → (S', Frame').

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Some changes modify the rules under which change is described. Tx names those meta‑changes: they alter the background against which states make sense.

## Philosophical Justification
If pointers and reach track structure within a frame, we also need operators that account for frame shifts themselves. Otherwise, we misdescribe meta‑change as intraframe transitions and lose what is distinctive: variable identity conditions, novel invariants, or new observables.

## Explanation (informal)
Tx is a placeholder for a class of operators (to be formalized) that rotate, lift, or re‑parameterize the subject/space, making frame transitions explicit in the ontology.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Tx should integrate with pointer behavior (⇘² for meta‑monitoring), and with reach so that paths across frames compose properly.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Specify algebra (composition, identity) and interaction with collapse/repair.
