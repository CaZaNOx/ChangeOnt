Overview:
Entropy (Σ) measures diversity/variety of return paths and configurations under change, complementing stability (SE) and identity criteria.

Canonical statements (to be linked):
- [[S-DF-entropy-co]] (DF)
- [[S-DR-entropy-vs-se]] (DR)

Dependencies:
- From: [[02_Concepts/C-identity-change]]
- To: [[02_Concepts/C-math-structures]]
