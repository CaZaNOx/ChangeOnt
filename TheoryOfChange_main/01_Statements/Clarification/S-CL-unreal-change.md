# Real change must stabilize; unreal change never becomes pattern

Change ontology reserves reality for differences that stabilize, recur, and leave trace—what we call patterns. Unreal change is any fluctuation that dissipates instantly, remains counterfactual, is structurally impossible, or is cancelled before feedback can reinforce it. It does not “exist” as a referenceable pattern because it never enters the recursion of persistent structure. This collapse-proof distinction keeps the ontology from inventing shadow realms of “unreal” content—only stabilized, recursively persistent events count, as AI_13 lines 6200‑6370 argue.
