# Recursive expectation — non-classical expectation via SRL and evaluation surface
## Statement (corollary)
In non-stationary frames, classical probability is inadequate; CO uses Structural Recurrence Likelihood (SRL) over the evaluation surface as a recursive expectation surrogate, aligned to LocalReach and breath validation.

## Philosophical Translation
Expectation is what reliably comes back under your way of moving — not a timeless frequency in a fixed world.

## Clarifications / Links to definitions
- [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-structural-recurrence-likelihood]] provides the surrogate to probability when frames shift.
- [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-evaluation-surface]] supplies the cost/likelihood field where expectation is computed.
- [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-locality-prior]] constrains which neighborhoods inform the expectation.
