# Element — EI — Change Operators (motif composition)
## Claim (formal)
Emit motif and composition counts using k‑gram detection and ε‑class quotients; supports OPS/J and routing.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Name and build with the elemental moves of change.

## Philosophical Justification
Complex structures are composed of recurring local motifs. By detecting and composing these motifs under ε‑closure, we gain a vocabulary and algebra for change that is robust to small variations. This supports analysis, control, and interpretability.

## Derivation (Formal/Operational)
```text
motif_counts := detect_kgrams(x_{1..t})
comp_counts := compose_classes(motifs, ≈_ε)
```

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Choice of k and closure tolerance should reflect domain invariants.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Benchmark motif maps against outcomes; feed results to router and order modules.
