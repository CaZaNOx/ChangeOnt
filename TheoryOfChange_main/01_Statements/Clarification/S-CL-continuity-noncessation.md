# Clarification — continuity means non-cessation, not geometric smoothness
## Content
Continuity here asserts unbroken happening (change does not cease), not differentiability or topological smoothness.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Time talk: map “temporal” phrasing to breath/RTV/LocalReach rather than metric time; use [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-prior-with-change]] and [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-locality-prior]] for non‑metric ordering.

## Implication
Separates ontic continuity from imported mathematical regularity.
