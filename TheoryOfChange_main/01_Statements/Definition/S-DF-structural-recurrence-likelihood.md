# Structural Recurrence Likelihood (SRL)
## Claim (formal)
SRL(P) := normalized recurrence score of pattern P under breath validation across LocalReach, serving as a surrogate for classical probability when frames and identities shift.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Instead of asking “how probable” in a fixed space, we ask “how reliably does this pattern recur” as the system breathes and adjusts.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- SRL composes with identity criteria (≈, invariants) and depends on RTV stability.

## Derivation (Formal)
```text
Let K be a validation window. SRL(P) := (1/|K|) * |{ k∈K : RTV_k(P) accepts ∧ Sim(T_k(P),P)≥θ }|
```
