# Cross-AI audits require verbatim evidence counts

When an AI claims to audit prior chat logs, require at least N=5 evidence lines (file+line+short quote) per 400 lines read, plus a running total of quoted slices. Without this running ledger the claimed knowledge transfer or prediction cannot be verified; this is the concrete enforcement AI_18 requests before trusting any "read it all" verdict.
