# Hypothesis — Malformed recursive agent diagnostics under contradiction pressure
Proposal
- Define failure signatures (e.g., SRL collapse, σ(ε) spikes, SE variance surges) for agents under contradictory constraints; catalog suppressed recursion strategies and recovery protocols.

Test sketch
- Apply paradoxical directives; measure SRL/σ(ε)/SE; classify collapse regimes and successful recovery steps.
