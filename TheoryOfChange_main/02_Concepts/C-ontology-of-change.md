# Ontology of Change
Overview:
The foundational stance that change (Δ) is ontically prior and structurally continuous; other structures (identity, subject, locality) arise as modulations of Δ.

Note on terminology: when referencing “attention,” we mean recursive prioritization over the evaluation surface, not a spatial spotlight; see [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-attention-recursive-filter]] and [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-ops-j3-attention-warp]]. Where time is mentioned, treat it as breath‑locked phase indexing per [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-perceived-time-breath-index]].

Canonical statements (to be linked):
- [[S-FT-immediate-datum]] (FT)
- [[S-DR-change-cannot-begin]] (DR)
- [[S-FT-continuity-noncessation]] (FT)

Dependencies:
- From: [[02_Concepts/C-performative-contradiction]]
- To: [[02_Concepts/C-subject-awareness-experience]]

Open items:
- Formal operators for frame transformation (Tx) needed for meta-change.
