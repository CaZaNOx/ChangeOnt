# Urgency, volatility, and plasticity drive felt deformation

Define prediction error \(e_t = y_t - \hat{y}_t\) with recursion-driven accumulators \(N_t\) and \(V_t\) tracking squared deviations and volatility. The urgency \(U_t = \alpha |e_t| + \beta V_t - \gamma N_t\) signals when to reallocate “change budget,” and emotion \(E_t = \phi(U_t)\) labels its valence. Plasticity \(\lambda_t = \Lambda(U_t, A_t, B_t)\) updates self-parameters \(\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \lambda_t \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(W_t, R_t)\), coupling feeling to self-deformation. These formulas give precise, measurable levers for testing whether a system “feels” its own structural delta before acting.
