# Predictive pattern — emergence of new attractors under Tx
## Claim (formal)
Under detected Tx, expect emergence of new attractors not permitted by fixed‑space models; measured by SRL gains and indicator incidence.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
When the rules change, new “stable patterns” can appear that a fixed model literally forbids; that is a falsifiable difference.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Benchmarks should report new attractor detection with GH/TX logs.
