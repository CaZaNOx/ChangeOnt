# Gödel limits — no complete and consistent self-containment of the generator
## Claim (formal)
For a consistent, recursively enumerable self-model Sᴹ of a subject/system, there exist true propositions φ about its generator L that Sᴹ cannot derive. Attempts to fully contain the generator within Sᴹ force a trade‑off: completeness vs consistency. Gödel holes manifest where inference halts or must defer to a higher context.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
No map can carry all of the territory that draws it. The very engine that drives novelty and learning cannot be fully bottled inside its own description. Honest systems expose their “unknown” gates rather than pretending closure.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Necessary openness: robust agents maintain explicit abstention/unknown modes and meta‑levels (no silent folding of meta into base).
- Exploration floor: non‑zero exploration is a logical consequence of incompleteness, not a mere heuristic.
- Ethical humility: shared gauges converge to adequate stability, not absolute finality.
