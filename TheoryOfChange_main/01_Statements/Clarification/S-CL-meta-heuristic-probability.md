# Treat stabilization clues as meta-heuristics grounded in field audit

Change ontology offers a meta-heuristic for judging when stabilization is likely: tight, constrained variable topologies hint at robust attractors, while loose, open, recursive topologies invite meta-chaos. These are not fixed probabilities but structural clues that must be tested against the field’s actual paths. The real contribution is a protocol for estimating when prediction is honest (by auditing the field, mapping attractor basins, and logging variable behavior) versus when openness forbids certainty. Use the heuristic to guide exploration, not to claim prior certainty, and always align claims with ledgered audit entries as AI_13 emphasizes in lines 3790‑3820.
