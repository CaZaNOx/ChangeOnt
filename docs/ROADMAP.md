# Roadmap (rungs)

**Rung 1 (theory complete, harness ready)**
- Finalize docs in this batch
- Unit tests for math & headers
- Renewal toy run HAQ vs FSM (parity fixture) — execution later

**Rung 2 (three families, ablations)**
- Drifting bandit: HAQ vs UCB/Thompson
- Grid maze: HAQ vs BFS/shortest path under perturbations
- Ablations: (a) only; (a)+(e); (a)+(e)+(f); full headers

**Rung 3 (external data & adversarial)**
- 1–2 small real datasets with nonstationarity
- Explicit adversarial tasks where CO should *not* help; parity or graceful degrade
