# Treat subjectivity as the primary datum; structure only tracks it

Change ontology starts from subjectivity as the irreducible datum: the living field of awareness, experience, and self-modulation is “reality” for the subject just as physical reality is for the physicist. Every third-person description is inevitably partial, producing holes and new paradoxes; structural signatures can only correlate with the datum, never replace it. Track subjectivity via multiple correlates (integration, attention, recursion, hole-sensitivity), eliminate proxies that contradict subjective presence, and keep the equation open to collapse whenever new evidence surfaces, per AI_13 lines 12563‑12648.
