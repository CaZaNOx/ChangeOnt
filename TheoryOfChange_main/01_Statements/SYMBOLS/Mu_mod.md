# μ_mod — Minimal modulation unit

Definition (formal):
Smallest modulation step after which re-anchoring ambiguity may occur.

## Math
```math
\mu_{mod} := \inf\{\Delta: \text{re-anchor ambiguous at resolution } \varepsilon\}
```

## Example
- Below μ_mod, pointer re-anchoring may be ill-defined.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Epsilon]] (ε)

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
There is a minimal step beyond which re-anchoring becomes ambiguous.

## Philosophical Justification
At very small scales, identity tracking can fail; μ_mod marks that practical boundary.

## Explanation (informal)
Use μ_mod to decide when to “snap” pointers or identities to new anchors.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Relates to grid/quantization in practical systems.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Define anchoring policies based on μ_mod and ε.
