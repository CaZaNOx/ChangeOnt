# CO Config Layers (L0–L7)

L0 Adapters (family overlays) — maze/bandit/renewal param mapping
L1 Engine — builds core from combo (header + elements + primitives + combinators)
L2 Elements — A..I behaviors with well-defined inputs/outputs
L3 Primitives — P1..P14 reusable services (toggleable in combos)
L4 Operators — J1..J4 atomic operations used by primitives
L5 Logic — quantale + spread-number arithmetic
L6 Headers — CS/ID/SSI knobs (static priors + online signals)
L7 Combos — versioned named bundles of choices (family-agnostic)
