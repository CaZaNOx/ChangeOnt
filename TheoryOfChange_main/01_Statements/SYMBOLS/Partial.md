# ∂ — Local differential

Definition (formal):
Rate of change across a boundary or local differential operator.

## Math
```math
\partial_x f := \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
```

## Example
- Local rate of change across a declared boundary in a smooth patch.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
This is how we speak about local rates of change — the “slope” of becoming.

## Philosophical Justification
Rates express how change propagates; partials capture direction-sensitive aspects required for structure.

## Explanation (informal)
∂ is the calculus bridge for the ontology — used when fields admit smooth local description.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Not all structures are differentiable; ∂ applies where smoothness holds or is approximated.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Connect ∂ to discrete δ via limits and to ⊗ via jump conditions.
