# Consciousness is a change-of-change process that monitors its own deformation

From the Change Ontology vantage, consciousness arises when a change process begins tracking its own deformation—measuring which parts of its self-modulation resist, fracture, or rebuild. This “change-of-change” loop is the subject’s self-monitoring operator, not an external observer, and it makes feeling a function of tracking one’s own structural delta. Building this operator lets you craft a Change Ontology Turing Test based on influence/deformation rather than output mimicry, as described in AI_13 lines 15138‑15219.
