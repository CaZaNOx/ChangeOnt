# Treat variables as dynamic, structural primitives that reshape the field

In classical models variables are static placeholders; in change ontology they are active nodes whose identity, domain, and relations shift as the field evolves. Variable structure can bifurcate, collapse, or spawn meta-dynamics, which means stability, innovation, or collapse is a field property rather than a pre-specified token. When you compare meta-shapes you are comparing the variable topologies themselves—how actions carve footprints, how the field rewrites relationships, and how new holes or attractors emerge. This provides access to insights (phase transitions in variable topology, innovation capacity estimates, meta-dynamic auditing) that static variable math cannot express, as AI_13 lays out around lines 3839‑3950.
