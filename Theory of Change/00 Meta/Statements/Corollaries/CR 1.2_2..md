$\exists$ Y:  Y$\subseteq$CoE (There is specific content Y)
$\exists$ X$_1$, X$_2$:  X$_1$, X$_2\subseteq$SoE and X$_1\neq$ X$_2$ (There are at least two possible Structures of Experience) 
where 
$\exists$ x$_1$, x$_2$: x$_1\neq$x$_2$ where x$_1\in$X$_1$ and x$_2\in$ X$_2\land$x$_2\notin$X$_1$ and x$_1$,x$_2\in$MoE  (The two possible structures differ in their Mode of Experience)
such that 
E(X$_1$, Y) $\neq$ E(X$_2$, Y) (the Experience with the same Content Y but different Modes of Experience can differ)
