# Classical fixed-state tools cannot model emergent structure

Markov chains and related classical models presuppose a fixed state space and cannot genuinely create new variables, dimensions, or frames mid-run. In your change ontology, new structure emerges from structural tension, collapse, and pointer failure, so the space itself can grow or reconfigure. Classical tools may only emulate this by smuggling in every possible decomposition ahead of time, which defeats the structural novelty we seek. This is the critical gap highlighted in AI_13 lines 900‑1030.
