# PRM — Dissociation Cascade metric
## Claim (formal)
Define a dissociation cascade metric DC that increases when gauge alignment weakens and identity stabilization energy (SE) drops under rising entropy (Σ) and sensitivity fluctuation (σ(ε)). DC captures the propensity for structure to fragment into non‑integrating subloops across breath cycles.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
When coordination weakens and stabilizing energy falls while diversity rises, systems tend to split into parts that stop fitting back together. The metric DC names and tracks this risk.

## Operational sketch
- Inputs: alignment curvature/strain (Γ), stabilization energy (SE), entropy (Σ), σ(ε) dynamics.
- Example form (domain‑specific normalization implied):
  - DC ≈ w₁·Σ ↑ + w₂·σ(ε) ↑ + w₃·Γ ↑ − w₄·SE ↓
- Interpretation: higher DC indicates increased risk of dissociative fragmentation of identity under breath.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- PRM scope: diagnostic primitive; domain‑specific choices for weights and normalization depend on the evaluation surface and evidence algebra.
- Links: tie to collapse/RTV budget and non‑classical indicators via thresholds.
