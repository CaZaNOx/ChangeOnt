# Biology→Mind is hard only if new invariants require irreducible closure

The move from biology to mind counts as a hard Gödel jump only if it introduces invariants—awareness, recursion, intentionality—that cannot be reduced or reconstructed from biology, chemistry, or classical computation. Absent such irreducible new rules, the transition is a soft jump (compression/reorganization) that leaves the prior layer, in principle, recoverable. Only empirical evidence for a new meta-rule or closure (and the failure of downward derivation) would justify treating mind as a hard closure, otherwise the biology→mind leap remains an open question, as AI_13 emphasizes in lines 12118‑12144.
