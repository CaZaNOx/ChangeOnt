# Proto-number emergence from stabilization sequences
## Claim
Count, order, and the notion of "next" arise when discrete stabilization events (breath-phase locks) occur sequentially and maintain distinguishable identities. The recurrence of such events supplies a natural ordinal progression (first, next, …), so proto-numbers form without injecting pre-existing numerals. Maintaining Δ, breath field, and SE ensures that this emergent ordinal can later be retraced to full arithmetic.

## Operational sketch
- Track a breathing agent through successive stabilization zones; each zone yields a pointer/local reach snapshot.
- When zones remain distinct and non-merging, label them according to emergence order (first, second, third). These labels behave like proto-numbers.
- Use the pattern of breath-phase recurrence to define additive/ordering relations: consecutive stabilizations induce a proto-"+1" step.

## Implication
If this hypothesis holds, arithmetic can be derived from Change by following stabilization rhythms rather than importing ℕ or ℝ. It keeps math grounded in natural recursion while providing a path to classical counting as a derived layer from the breath field.
