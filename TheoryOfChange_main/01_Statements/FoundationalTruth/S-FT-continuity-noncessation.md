# Continuity — change does not cease (non‑cessation)
## Claim (formal)
If change cannot have a beginning, then it cannot globally cease or restart; continuity means non‑cessation (not necessarily smoothness).

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Change never globally stops or restarts; it keeps going (though it need not be smooth). What we call “rest” is a local description inside continuing change — not a cosmic halt. Continuity here means non‑cessation, not mathematical smoothness.

## Philosophical Justification
Global cessation would imply a transition (Δ → ¬Δ), which is itself Δ. Thus non‑cessation follows from the impossibility of a first change. In practice, continuity licenses talking about persistence and identity as modes of change rather than exceptions to it. It also underwrites why we can build stable descriptions: patterns persist because change can take forms that conserve invariants.

## Explanation (informal)
Continuity here is ontological (no absolute interruption), not geometric smoothness.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-DR-change-cannot-begin]], the mirror argument rules out a “last” change; hence no global cessation.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
From impossibility of first change, derive impossibility of last change by temporal symmetry of the argument schema.
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- proof: see formal schema in [[S-DR-change-cannot-begin]]

## Clarifications / Further Context
- “Continuity” does not assert differentiability or smooth calculus structure.
- See symbol: [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Delta]]

## Next Steps in Chain
- suggest: derive local continuity conditions in measurement protocols.
