# Only surviving constraints reveal the prior layer after a Gödel jump

Whenever a new layer is born from a Gödel hole, the old layer cannot be fully reconstructed—only the constraints, anomalies, or “fossil” paradoxes that survive as residues in the new logic remain visible. Map those historical footprints (quantum anomalies, cosmological irregularities, unexplained boundary conditions) to recover the hole’s shape, but do not mistake them for the entire prior rule set. This keeps the theory falsifiable and grounded: a prior layer’s specificity is forever erased unless its constraints become indispensable invariants in the successor logic, as argued in AI_13 lines 11836‑11858.
