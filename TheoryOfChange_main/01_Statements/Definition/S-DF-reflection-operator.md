# Reflection operator closes the loop across past/present/future selves
Let \(I_{t-\Delta}, I_t, \hat{I}_{t+\Delta}\) be the past, present, and imagined future self-states derived from the workspace and parameters \(W_t,\theta_t,\pi_t\). The reflection operator \(\mathcal{I}\) integrates them with current feeling \(E_t\):
\[
I_t^* = \mathcal{I}(I_{t-\Delta}, I_t, I_{t+\Delta}, E_t).
\]
This operator generates the threefold self-loop and increases presence when \(A_t>0\) and \(\partial I_t/\partial E_t \neq 0\); the reflexive access \(A_t\) measures how much the self-model invests the reflection with its own trajectory.
