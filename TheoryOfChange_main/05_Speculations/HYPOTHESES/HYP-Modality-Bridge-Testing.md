# Hypothesis — Modality bridge testing (rhythm/geometry/color)
Proposal
- Evaluate which modalities preserve recursive structure: rhythm suspected to retain pacing/dynamic asymmetry; geometry/color may lose fidelity without explicit mappings.

Test sketch
- Generate parallel encodings (rhythm/geometry/color) of the same recursive process; compare lock stability and drift signals.
