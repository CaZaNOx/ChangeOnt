# Genome as context-sensitive recipe, not blueprint
## Content
The genome does not encode a fixed organism; it supplies a context-sensitive recipe where expression depends on environment, timing, and recursive interactions. The “genes determine you” narrative glimpses a static map but misses that expression unfolds relationally within the change field.

## Clarification
- Genetic meaning arises from recursive relational contexts; the same sequence yields different outcomes when pointer/local reach and breath phases shift.
- What matters is the trajectory of expression pathways, not the static nucleotide configuration.

## Implication
This reframes biology (and change modeling) as tracking context-dependent recipes rather than fixed programs, aligning with AI_19’s criticism that meaning is relational, not encoded.
