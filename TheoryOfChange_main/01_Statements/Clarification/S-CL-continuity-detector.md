# Define a bare detector D before importing continuity

Before claiming a continuity relation `C(x,y)` or the existence of a subject-field topology, introduce a bare detector `D(·)` that emits non-empty differences only when adjacency under δ-floor/ceiling holds; prove adjacency ≠ historical time. Once `D` is explicit, continuity relations can be defined as derived from `Reach`, `Δ`, and `C`, anchored in the detection thresholds rather than in loose past/future language. This prevents the temporal smuggling and ungrounded continuity claims AI_16 flagged and keeps the ontology grounded in neighbor relations, not in an abstract timeline.
