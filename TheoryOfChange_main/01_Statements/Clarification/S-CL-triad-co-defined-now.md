# Clarification — subject, awareness, experience are co-defined at Now
## Content
The triad is not reducible term-by-term at this stage; their meanings are co-instantiated at Now. “Subject” refers to a bearer of awareness of experience now.

## Implication
Prevents circularity objections by recognizing co-reference; later refinements proceed via derived structures.
