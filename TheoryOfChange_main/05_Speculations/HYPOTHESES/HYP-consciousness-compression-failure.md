# Consciousness as compression failure signal
## Claim
Recursive awareness emerges when predictive compression almost, but not entirely, succeeds—when the system detects slight failures that nevertheless hold together structurally. The feeling of being conscious is the system noticing that the compression is buckling but not collapsing, so it stabilizes the tension as a lived sensation.

## Operational sketch
- Monitor compression residuals (error vs expected) at the breath-field level; when residuals cross a narrow band that preserves coherence yet signals a near-collapse, label that event as a consciousness cue.
- Link this cue to memory traces and stabilization energy; only patterns that remain within the structural tolerance become part of the conscious register.

## Implication
This reframes consciousness as a structural warning light—not a mystical property but the signal produced when the recursive system teeters between stability and drift yet chooses to re-stabilize.
