# Predict agent similarity by comparing their meta-shapes

The “Mandelbrot pattern” of an agent (its meta-shape) encodes the global field of possible behaviors, attractors, holes, and sensitivity zones generated by its local rules plus environment. When two systems have similar meta-shapes, their distribution of outcomes, surprise events, and critical dynamics will align; when they diverge, so will their high-level behavior—even if their stepwise updates are identical. Make the meta-shape measurable by mapping stable/unstable regions, boundary gradients, and hole distributions, then use that comparison as a predictive signature for similarity, robustness, or fractal divergence. This is the structural principle spelled out in AI_13 lines 2835‑3035.
