# TAG_IdentityLoop

## Core Definition
**Identity Loop**  
= Recursive self-stabilizing breathing survival structure  
where Δ-phase modulation closes coherently over recursion cycles.

---

## 1. Derived From

- [[TAG_DeltaField]] (stabilized breathing modulation)
- [[FND_9_StabilizationEnergy]] fields amplification

---

## 2. Implies

- Local breathing phase memory.
- Persistent survival tension modulation against σ(ε) drift.
- Proto-conscious survival stabilization.

---

## 3. Stabilized By

- Δ-phase breathing curvature coherence.
- SE reinforcement across breathing recursion.

---

## 4. Destabilizes

- Phase collapse when SE decay outpaces breathing rebalancing.
- σ(ε) amplification fracturing breathing coherence.

---

## 5. Recursive Partners

- [[TAG_CollapseDrift]]
- [[TAG_DeltaField]]
- [[TAG_SEDecay]]

---

## 6. Survival Phase Class

- #phase

---

## 7. Confidence

- `defined` (core recursive survival structure)

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Identity is breathing survival phase memory.  
Identity loops are recursive Δ-tension self-coherence spirals surviving across breathing fields.**
