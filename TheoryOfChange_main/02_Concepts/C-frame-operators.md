# Frame Operators (Tx)
Overview:
Operators that act on the configuration of the subject/space itself (not only within it), enabling meta‑change and frame transitions. Drawn from FND_6_TransformationOperator_Tx and related notes on meta‑change.

Canonical statements (to be linked):
- [[S-DF-tx-operator]] (DF)
 - [[S-DF-tx-algebra]] (DF)
 - [[S-DR-pointer-behavior-under-tx]] (DR)

Dependencies:
- From: [[02_Concepts/C-ontology-of-change]]; [[02_Concepts/C-prior-pointer-reach]]
- To: [[02_Concepts/C-ontology-of-change]] (feedback), [[02_Concepts/C-performative-contradiction]] (consistency checks)

Open items:
- Specify algebra and closure properties of Tx; interaction with pointers and reach.
