# Global broadcast distributes the specious present across workspaces
The operator \(\mathcal{B}:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{W}\) maps the time-kernel–filtered state \(\bar{x}_t\) into a global workspace \(W_t = \mathcal{B}(\bar{x}_t)\) where subsystems share information. A scalar \(B_t \in [0,1]\) tracks the bandwidth or reachability of that workspace. Maintaining invariance of the broadcast while logging its reach lets you compare attention/focus across agents and makes “global availability” testable rather than metaphorical.
