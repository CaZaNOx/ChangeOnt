# Phenomenology of Time — Breath‑locked Phase Indexing
Overview:
Subjective “time” is modeled as indexing of recursive validation phases coordinated by breath; sensitive to σ(ε). No claims about physical time are made here; see [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-perceived-time-breath-index]].

Canonical statements:
- [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-perceived-time-breath-index]]
- [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-breath-field-global-integrator]]
- [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-rtv-operator]]
- [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-sigma-fluctuation]]

Open items:
- No claims about physical time; possible bridges require careful modeling.
