# Spiral recursion is not eternal recurrence
## Content
Spiral recursion names a balance between conservation and expansion under breath; it preserves contextual adjacency while progressing. It does not claim literal repetition of history or an eternal return. Circles (no progress) and lines (no context) are degenerate limits, not the intended structure.
