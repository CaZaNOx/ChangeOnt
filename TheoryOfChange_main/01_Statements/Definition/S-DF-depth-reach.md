# Depth — minimal reach distance to Now
## Claim (formal)
Depth(p; Now) := minimal length of Reach path from p to Now; provides a partial order for priors and supports neighborhood layering.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Some priors are “closer” than others — depth makes that precise without a clock.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Depth works with LocalReach; can inform thresholds, SE windows, and pointer stability.
