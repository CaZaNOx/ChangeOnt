# Action selection modulates future evidence and expectation
## Statement (corollary)
By choosing actions, the subject reshapes the future evaluation surface and empirical SRL, thereby modulating recursive expectation.

## Philosophical Translation
What you do next changes what will likely happen and what you’ll come to expect.
