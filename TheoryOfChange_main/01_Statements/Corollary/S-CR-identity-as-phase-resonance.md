# Identity as cross‑phase resonance under recursive change
Corollary: Attempts to model subjective permanence as static structure collapse; identity persists as a resonance maintained across recursive phases, captured by invariants and supported by SE under RTV cycles.

Philosophical translation
- Self is not a fixed form but a pattern of maintained similarities across transformation phases.
