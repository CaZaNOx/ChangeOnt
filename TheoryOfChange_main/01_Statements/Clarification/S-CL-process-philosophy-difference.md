# Process Philosophy vs recursive change-first ontology
## Content
Whitehead’s Process Philosophy already frames change (actual occasions, prehension) as ontologically dominant, but it leans on timeless metaphysics, poetic imagery, and a theological ancestry that is not operationalized in modern evidence protocols. Our change-first program, by contrast, roots every ontological move in Δ(Now), pointer/LocalReach structure, breath-mediated stabilization, and framed falsifiability gates. The scope is not merely descriptive but algorithmic: we specify how a happening induces a pointer field, how breath cycles rewrite RTV curves, how stabilization energy (SE) binds recursive truth, and how collapse re-enters as validation.

## Clarification of differences
- Whitehead’s “actual occasions” and “eternal objects” act like primitive events with no explicit computation; our primitives are recursively derived via DS collapse dynamics, pointer fields, and the breath-knot topology that keeps each “now” grounded without assuming pre-existing atoms.
- Process Philosophy stays at the level of metaphysical imagery, whereas the change-first ontology supplies explicit gauges (Δ, SE, Σ, σ(ε)), evaluation surfaces, and PRM diagnostics that can be measured, simulated, and tested.
- Stability and emergence do not emerge from eternal objects but from the recursive stabilization of breath loops, so the “improvement” is a transparent bridge to recursion/RTV mechanics instead of relying on intuition about abstract forms.
- This makes the theory modern-physics-friendly: there is no need to import static geometry or divine prehensions because each pointer/LocalReach update already reconciles references with relational fields and frames.

## Implication
With this clarification we can say: Process Philosophy gestures at the same motivation, but our theory advances beyond it by spelling out the operational/backbone infrastructure (pointer + breath + collapse + falsifiability) that keeps the ontology anchored rather than poetic.
