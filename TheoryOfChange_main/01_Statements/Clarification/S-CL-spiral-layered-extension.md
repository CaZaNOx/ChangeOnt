# Spiral meta-pattern extends recursively beyond the first four phases

Every layer that can support further meta-differentiation (chemistry, biology, mind, society, technology) does not stop at phases a1‑a4; it runs through additional turns (a5: integration of integrations, a6: meta-crises, a7: new differentiations, etc.) generated by the same self-similar spiral logic. These higher turns are constrained by resource, option, and hole density, but insofar as a system keeps accumulating recursive depth it will eventually climb the spiral further. The universe itself (slowest cycle) mirrors this pattern: its next leaps are governed by its own option/hole density, not by the faster meta-leaps of nested layers. This fractal extension means no finite boundary stops the spiral so long as complexity, feedback, and openness persist.
