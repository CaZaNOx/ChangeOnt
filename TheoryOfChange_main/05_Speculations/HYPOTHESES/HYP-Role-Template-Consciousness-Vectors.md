# HYP — Role-Template Consciousness Vectors and Normalization

Claim (hypothesis)
- Repeated adoption of role templates (e.g., RPG classes) induces measurable shifts in a subject’s attention vector across axes (recursive, reflexive, affective). Population normalization yields role profiles and individual susceptibility metrics.

Test sketch
- Protocol: within-subject design; instrument attention axes via task interference and self-report aligned to [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-attention-focus]] and breath‑phase markers [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-breath-field-global-integrator]].
- Outputs: role vector means; subject deltas; robustness across sessions.
