> PC$\subseteq$ SC 
> holds because because PC limits the contradictions to a subject expressing a specific proposition that is in contradiction with the act performed by the subject. 
> While SC also holds even if the subject isn't expressing the condition specifically. It holds that any SC can be made a PC when the subject expresses it as proposition.
> This relaxation of PC to SC allows us to formulate structurally true statements by negating the x that would cause SC. This hold for any CoE(x) even if x is not causing a PC by expressing it currently.
