# LLN on quotients requires drift guards and sample floors

Claims that quotients or merged classes obey a law of large numbers must specify the drift guard, sample floors (e.g., ≥50 visits/class), and stopping rule: only when the guard reading stays within thresholds for the required number of observations can the law be declared valid. This prevents premature collapse claims and matches the AI_17 insistence on LLN-conditioned correctness before publishing invariants.
