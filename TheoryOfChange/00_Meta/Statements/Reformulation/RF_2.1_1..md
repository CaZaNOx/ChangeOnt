Of [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] and [[DF 1.3_1.]]
1) Change happens ([[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]])
2) Change enables happening([[DF 1.3_1.]])
So if we try to insert one definition into the other we get
- That which enables happening happens ([[DF 1.3_1.]]  inserted into [[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]])
- That what happens enables happening ([[DF 0.7_1. (DF 0.6)]] inserted into [[DF 1.3_1.]] )
What this highlights is not only that change leads to change but also that what happens changes.
In essence this all is an expression of a fundamental understanding of change as dynamic in nature.
This isn't just empty wordplay instead this reflections about the used definitions allows us to state that any difference that we notice was enabled by change. If nothing happened or no happening was enabled there could never be difference.
Another way to express this is that the above definitions put together express that
