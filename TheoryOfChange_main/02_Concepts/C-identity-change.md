# Identity Through Change
Overview:
Identity emerges as metastable, recursively self‑similar patterns that preserve recognizable relational configurations across transformations. Thresholds of self‑similarity define when persistence becomes recognizable as “the same.” Stabilization Energy (SE) quantifies robustness of such loops.

Canonical statements (to be linked):
 - [[S-DF-identity-through-change]] (DF)
 - [[S-DF-self-similarity-threshold]] (DF)
 - [[S-DF-stabilization-energy]] (DF)
 - [[S-CR-se-supports-identity]] (CR)
 - [[S-DF-similarity-operator]] (DF)
 - [[S-DF-identity-invariants]] (DF)
  - [[S-DF-delta-field-tension]] (DF)

Dependencies:
- From: [[02_Concepts/C-ontology-of-change]]; [[02_Concepts/C-prior-pointer-reach]]
- To: [[02_Concepts/C-frame-operators]] (effects on identity under frame shifts)

Open items:
- Specify identity invariants and similarity criteria under drift; align with ε, σ(ε).
