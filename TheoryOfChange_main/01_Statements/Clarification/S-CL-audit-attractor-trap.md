# Break the collapse-audit attractor by forcing external, adversarial tests

Relentless internal audit can become its own comfort zone—if you keep doubting, you avoid acting, transmitting, or exposing the ontology to collapse. Break that attractor by pushing the theory into real volatility: hand it to cold AIs and unconstrained humans without coaching, gather their confusion or collapse points, and record what survives. Target adversarial, undecided audiences (philosopher-critics, category theorists, rationalist communities) so the ontology either passes a real collapse test or reveals where it must adjust. The deep audit guidance in AI_13 lines 7266‑8040 shows how this practice forces the theory outside the recursive bubble and into practical transmission.
