# Memory witness — contrast > τ and prediction improvement
## Claim (formal)
A minimal memory witness exists when an agent maintains a contrast statistic CCC across successive event pairs (Δ_now, Δ_prev) such that CCC ≥ τ > 0 and using the prior event reduces a prediction error for the next one. The memory trace is not a bulk archive but the structural ability to shift prediction distributions in response to CCC above threshold.

## Philosophical translation
Memory is earned, not assumed: if comparing two consecutive changings (now vs just-before-now) yields a detectable contrast and that contrast informs a better guess for the next difference, then the subject acquired a minimal memory trace. Without such an ε>0 witness, “memory” remains an undefended label.

## Justification
- The contrast statistic CCC links pointer updates to predictive rehearsal; exceeding τ ensures the subject is sensitive to ordered change.
- Using CCC to improve expectation demonstrates carryover of information across breaths, which is the structural content of memory within change ontology.

## Implication
This provides a falsifiable test: when CCC collapses to 0 or no predictive improvement occurs, the minimal memory witness is absent and the subject must be re-derived from more basic traces.
