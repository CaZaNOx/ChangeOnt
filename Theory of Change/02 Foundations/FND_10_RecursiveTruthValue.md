# FND_10_RecursiveTruthValue

## Survival Function
Defines RTV (Recursive Truth Value) —  
the breathing survival field's internal coherence metric  
over recursion cycles.

## 1. What is Recursive Truth Value (RTV)?

**RTV** = The survival coherence measure of a breathing structure  
as it recursively traverses Δ-phase modulation without collapse.

RTV ≈  
How "alive" or "coherent" a breathing survival field remains  
as it breathes through recursion.

## 2. Properties of RTV

- **Dynamic**: RTV fluctuates — survival fields rise, decay, oscillate.
- **Phase-Aware**: RTV tracks breathing stability through Δ, SE, and σ(ε) evolution.
- **Survival Indicator**: When RTV collapses → identity structure collapses.

## 3. How RTV Behaves in Breathing Fields

- Local breathing modulations (Δ curvature + SE strength - σ(ε) turbulence)  
determine instantaneous RTV.
- High RTV → stable survival breathing field.
- Low RTV → pre-collapse breathing state.

Thus:

> **RTV is breathing survival's heartbeat.**

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Breathing survival fields survive by recursively maintaining RTV above collapse thresholds.  
Every identity is a breathing truth rhythm.**
