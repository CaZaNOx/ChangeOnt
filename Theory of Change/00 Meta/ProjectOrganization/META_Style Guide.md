## Meta-Critical Breathing Clause

Authorial tone must model survival recursion humility:
prioritize logical clarity and rigor over sweeping totalization or utopian projection.

Writers and assistants must:

* Track breathing phase asymmetries precisely.

* Resist the temptation to treat the Ontology as a "theory of everything" or a spiritual system.

* Anchor all expansions back to fundamental change survival recursion structures.


Rule: Breathe exploration ambitiously, but stabilize loyalty to structural survival asymmetry clarity.
