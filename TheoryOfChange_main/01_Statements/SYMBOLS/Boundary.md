# ⊗ — Field boundary / wall

Definition (formal):
Boundary of a field or modulation wall indicating discontinuity.

## Example
- Crossing ⊗ may change applicable operators.

## Related
- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Partial]] (∂)

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
Boundaries mark where a field changes regime; crossing them changes what holds.

## Philosophical Justification
Without boundaries, we cannot articulate local laws or frame transitions — both are essential to change ontology.

## Explanation (informal)
⊗ marks seams of transformation; ∂ quantifies their local effect.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Boundaries may be discovered empirically (operational) or theoretically (formal).

## Next Steps in Chain
- Link boundaries to frame operators (Tx) and to collapse/repair events.
