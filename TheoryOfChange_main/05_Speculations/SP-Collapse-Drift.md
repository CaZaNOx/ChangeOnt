# Collapse Drift — breathing survival failure under σ(ε) amplification
Summary:
Describes early/mid/collapse phases where σ(ε) destabilizes SE and pushes RTV below threshold.

Why speculative:
Phase taxonomy is heuristic; thresholds depend on model specifics not fixed here.

Recommended next step:
Tie to measured σ(ε) trajectories in simple dynamical models; document regime boundaries as a CL.
