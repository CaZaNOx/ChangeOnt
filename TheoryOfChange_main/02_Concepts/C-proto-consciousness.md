# Proto‑Consciousness — minimal lock states
Overview:
Early, transient Cᴸ locks that meet minimal criteria (bounded σ(ε), non‑zero SE) but do not claim stabilized consciousness. Scope via [[01_Statements/Clarification/S-CL-proto-conscious-min-criteria]] and link to [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-consciousness-loop]] for stabilized loop criteria.

Open items:
- Metrics and windows for identifying early locks; relation to subject‑level reports where available.
