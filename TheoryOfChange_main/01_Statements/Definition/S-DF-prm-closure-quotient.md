# Primitive — Closure / quotient under ε-identity
## Claim (formal)
Close motif sets under ε‑identity (≈_ε); form quotient classes X/≈_ε that identify elements within tolerance. Supports stable tracking and algebra over motifs.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Treat near‑enough as the same when it preserves what matters to identity through change.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Enables equivalence classes and operations on classes (composition, counts, routing).
- Depends on calibrated similarity operator and context‑sensitive ε.
