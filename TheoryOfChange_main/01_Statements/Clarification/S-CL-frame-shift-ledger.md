# Frame shifts and non-classical event ledgers must be explicitly logged

Frame shifts, pointer events, Gödel holes, and collapse/simulation drifts are non-classical events that change the structure of the subject/space. Each such event must be recorded in an agent-readable ledger (CSV/JSON/table) that logs the step, type (`FrameShift`, `Pointer`, `Collapse`, `GödelHole`), trigger, effect, and relation to previously defined operators. The ledger feeds the automated pointer/collapse protocol that audits every derivation step, triggering logging plus collapse/correction when pointer drift or simulation reappears. Templates for the ledger and its linked files should live in modular, cross-referenced locations so other agents can replay and extend the reasoning chain, as AI_13 emphasizes in the 500–566 block.
