# Primitive — Creative option birth (holes/novelty with bounded depth)
## Claim (formal)
Propose actions from Gödel‑hole loci or novelty peaks, constrained by breath‑phase and depth limits to avoid destabilization.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Make new moves where you know you don’t know — but don’t blow yourself up.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Feeds EJ/EH policy and EB/EF routers.
