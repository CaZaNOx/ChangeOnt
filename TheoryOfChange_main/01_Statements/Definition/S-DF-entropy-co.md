# Entropy (Σ) in Change Ontology
## Claim (formal)
Σ measures diversity/variety of return paths/configurations under breath, complementing stability (SE) and identity criteria (≈, invariants).

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
It tells how many different “ways back” a pattern has as the world breathes.
