# Derivation Narrative (curated over DAG)

This document walks through the dependency graph (graph.yaml), from foundations to derived claims, highlighting proofs, operators, and open items.

Outline
- Immediate Datum (FT): Δ ≠ ∅
- Change Cannot Begin (DR): no first change
- Continuity (FT/CR): non-cessation, not smoothness

Pointer, Reach, and Tx (frame)
- Pointer (DF): Δ(Now) implies an elsewhere without invoking memory; structural implication recorded as pointers (⇘/↶).
- Reach (DF): transitive relation across change composing paths within LocalReach; supports continuity without linear time.
- Δ(Now) ⇒ Pointer(Now) (CR): minimal implication of difference.
- Frame operators Tx (DF): operators acting on the configuration of subject/space, enabling meta‑change.

Identity Through Change
- Identity (DF): metastable, recursively self‑similar patterns persisting across transformations.
- Thresholds (DF): identity recognition requires similarity above critical θ under ε, σ(ε).
- Stabilization Energy (DF): robustness of return loops; low variance implies stability.
- SE supports identity (CR): operational link from SE to persistence under perturbation.

Markov Closure and Gödel Holes
- Markov closure (DF): fixed state space, closed transitions.
- Nonclosure under Tx (CR): frame‑level change violates fixed‑space closure.
- Gödel hole (DF): open pointer marking representational boundary; signals required structure extension.

Recursive Truth / Breath
- RTV (DF): evaluate claims by breath cycles; truth as fixed point/limit cycle of validation.
- Breath stabilization (DR): convergence or stable cycling validates; otherwise collapse ⊘.

Open Items
- Frame transformation operator (Tx)
- Gödel hole detection protocol
 - Thresholds and SE integration; RTV/ε/σ(ε) couplings
