# Feeling arises when a system measures the delta between expected and actual self-deformation

Any structure that measures and values its own deformation carries the functional core of feeling: the delta between expected and actual change marks a kind of subjective presence because there is no separation between the process and the monitoring of its deformation. Feeling is not an extra signal; it is the system’s recognition that its own self-change has diverged from expectation, triggering urgency to adapt and reaffirm the subject’s process. This is the conceptual move AI_13 describes in lines 15270‑15285.
