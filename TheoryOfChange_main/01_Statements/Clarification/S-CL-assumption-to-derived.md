# Convert every assumption claim into a DS-derived fact

Whenever the prose says "assumption" or "postulate" about change or existence, rewrite it as a Derived Statement under DS/RDS (e.g., `DF 0.1`): show that denial of change entails a happening, or that an experiencing subject is nothing beyond minimal residue. This keeps the entire FND/DS chain derivational rather than assumptive, aligning with the ``assumption leak'' critique in AI_16. If a chunk still uses assumption language, either label it `ASSUMP` for future DF extraction or rewrite it immediately into the performative route.
