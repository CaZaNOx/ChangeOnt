## Motivation
I developed a desire for truth early on in my Life and tried to follow it as clearly as possible to wherever it would lead me. During my studies of Philosophy I focused on Philosophy of Mind to understand what it is that absorbs and processes the world we expierience. But the more I seemed to study and investigate the more overly static the terms and concepts and ideas I was exploring became. It seemed like there was always something missing. Over time this concern so strong that I formulated the idea to revisit my core assumptions and the philosophical routes I was basing myself on.
I wanted to look for something more dynamic giving us additional mental tools to capture what was seemingly always slipping away when discussing conciousness in particular.
Following you will find my findings.
## Introduction 
 
## 1.1 The Importance of Ontology


Ontology is the inquiry into what fundamentally exists and what constitutes reality. Ontology has been core discipline of Philosophy since the very begining and only recently has become less prominent due to the postmodern criticism of big overarching dogmatic Worldviews. Or the rise of Modern Science that tries to explain from the ground up in different local domains. 
However Ontology is not something you can escape. The ontological framing and usage of concepts will exist and have an inpact no matter how unseemingly they are included.
Finally the ontological frame shapes not only metaphysical theories,  
but also ethics, epistemology, and scientific modeling and is important to study.

One way to think of a Ontology is to imagine a Tabula raza, a whiteboard with no assumptions written on it.
Classical ontology traditionally grounds itself in stable concepts like:

- Substance,
- Being,
- Mind,
- or Matter.

These serve as first Axiom to be written on the Tabula raza. Each of the stable concepts can not in itself generate change or at least isn't traditionally used to do so. As a result with this first assumption alone the models are static and unproductive not leading to further insights. Consequently those frameworks need to include change or time via a second axiom of change as Onthological truth. However change included like this creates either a system that still focuses on the first assumption and threats change as more of an afterthought or change is a rival/equal onthological concept that creates a duality of the two axioms where both are true on their own as fundamental entities without a clear logical relation and how this interactions work or how to resolve arising contradictions. This applies both to axiomatic systems that explicitly express the axioms as well as systems that only implicitly import a set of core axioms that are not further investigated. Even modern scientific model have those core assumptions by both assuming stable entities like particles and fields aswell as introducing a rule set applicable to the whole domain forever where those rules are just explored and measured but not explained in a deeper sense.

Further even with change included those systems can't as such to Derrive further insights. Those seem more like additional insertions that explain the behavior observed by just positing it in accordance with observations. 

Despite millennia of refinement,  
persistent contradictions and explanatory limitations remain and seem to be layed uncovered more and more in modern scientific topics where classical assumptions become insuficient. 
Those issues are TODO

## 1.2 Why Classical Ontologies Remain Unsatisfactory

Three core problems persist in traditional ontological models:

The classical ontological approaches (existence-first, substance-first) briefly mentioned.

"This section outlines a fundamental issue within classical ontology—namely, the primacy of existence—and argues why this view inherently leads to paradox and explanatory gaps."

- Clearly define "existence-first ontology":
    
    - What does it mean to say something "exists" in classical philosophy?
        
    - Brief historical references (Plato’s forms, Aristotelian substances, Descartes' substance dualism, etc.).
        
- Briefly illustrate the intuitive appeal:
    
    - Stable reality, common-sense alignment, intuitive perception of objects as stable entities.
        
### 1.2.1 Static Being Paradox

Ontologies grounded in pure static being (whether substance or mind) struggle to account for:

- Transformation,
- Temporality,
- Emergence of novelty.

If existence is fundamentally static,  
then change appears paradoxical
an unexplained rupture within an otherwise inert foundation.

- The explanatory gap: stable entities fail to explain temporality, transformation, identity continuity, emergence, etc.



- Example: "Ship of Theseus"—how classical existence-based ontology struggles to define persistent identity.
     
- Example: "River paradox" (Heraclitus)—the river is always changing; what exactly persists as "river"?
### 1.2.2 Hidden Metaphysical Inflation

Materialist and realist ontologies often posit:

- Stable entities (particles, fields),
- And stable, timeless laws governing their interactions.

Yet the existence of both simultaneously demands an unexplained,  
and often unacknowledged,  
dual metaphysical substrate:

- The domain of entities,
- And the domain of governing principles.

The coordination and universality of such laws remains metaphysically assumed,  
rather than derived.

### 1.2.3 Lack of Structural Productivity

Idealist, materialist, and hybrid ontologies often postulate their foundational assumptions,  
but struggle to systematically derive:

- Identity,
- Stability,
- Temporality,
- Persistence.

These properties are imported or asserted,  
rather than shown to emerge necessarily from the proposed foundations.

## 1.3 The Need for Reinvestigation

Given these issues and tensions it is well worth to investigate if other Onthologies the perform better can be found. A viable new Onthology should attempt to minimize arbitrary assumptions, resolve historical paradoxes and itself be a productive tool to gain further insights instead of being post hoc declarations. Therefore we have to ask again: 


What is the most minimal and logically sufficient ground for ontology?

---
## 1.4 The Hidden Role of Change in Classical Ontologies

- Clearly argue that even existence-first ontologies implicitly rely on the concept of change to handle contradictions (e.g., Aristotle’s "potentiality", Whitehead’s "process philosophy" as a partial acknowledgment).
    
- Identify why these attempts remain partial, insufficient, or paradoxical.
    

## 1.5 Toward a New Foundation: The Primacy of Change
- Clearly and concisely propose your alternative viewpoint:
    
    - "What if, instead of assuming existence as fundamental and deriving change from it, we begin directly from Change itself?"
        
    - State explicitly the primary insight that will be explored in the manuscript: "The proposition that Change is ontologically primary solves classical paradoxes and explanatory issues."
        
This project proposes a different starting point:

> **Change itself is ontologically primary.**


Change is not treated as a derivative or secondary phenomenon,  
but as the fundamental axiom
from which existence, identity, and temporality emerge.

The sections that follow will argue that:

- Change is immediately observable and structurally necessary.
- Being and stability arise from structured regularities within continuous transformation.
- Classical paradoxes and dualisms dissolve when change is used as core axiom.



I will attempt to shown that:

- Beginning from Change minimizes metaphysical inflation,
- Resolves longstanding paradoxes regarding transformation and persistence,
- And provides a systematically and productive framework for understanding philosophical ontology and future scientific exploration.

## 1.6 Summary & Transition

- Clearly summarize the limitations identified with classical ontology and restate briefly your alternative proposal.
    
- Clearly state the transition to next section:
    
    - "In the following sections, we formally present and logically support an ontology of Change-first."
