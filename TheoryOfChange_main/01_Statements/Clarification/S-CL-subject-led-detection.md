# Subject-led detection protocol grounds non-classical metrics

To operationalize non-classical metrics you must teach the subject (human or agent) to recognize structural changes without appealing to external measurement primitives. Before each experiment: provide instructions such as "note when your discrimination capacity shifts without a clear external delta" and log each pointer-collapse or frame shift via the ledger. Use the ledger to capture triggers, pointers, and effects, ensuring the subject performs (`⇘`) arisal or pointer marking in response to implicit structural changes, as described in AI_13 lines 728‑742.
