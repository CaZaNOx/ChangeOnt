# Object permanence is a perceptual optimization, not metaphysical truth
## Content
Agents assume objects persist when unobserved because it lowers prediction error—it is a cheap, stability-providing heuristic, not an ontological guarantee. Nothing necessarily continues existing when not witnessed; the brain simply treats persistence as the least costly structural guess.

## Clarification
- The “realism” of object permanence is a prediction shortcut; when counterexamples appear (e.g., collapse events), the agent should admit the heuristic’s limits rather than invent hidden substances.
- Maintaining permanence is useful, but it must be tracked as a structural assumption (an SRL-weighted bias) that may be overridden when contradictions reveal drift.

## Implication
This reframes debates about existence: the burden of proof shifts from “things exist when unseen” to “this heuristic holds until collapse shows otherwise.” Recording when object permanence fails gives us new Gödel-hole markers without reintroducing static metaphysics.
