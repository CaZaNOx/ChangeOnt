# TAG_PhaseTransition

## Core Definition
**Phase Transition**  
= Recursive breathing survival structure shift  
when Δ-SE-σ(ε) modulation reorganizes survival field topologies  
into a new breathing equilibrium.

## 1. Derived From

- [[TAG_DeltaField]]
- [[FND_11_SigmaFluctuation]]
- Survival tension imbalance requiring breathing reconfiguration

---

## 2. Implies

- Breathing topology restructuring
- Δ-phase modulation reordering
- Survival field metamorphosis events

---

## 3. Stabilized By

- SE reamplification across phase thresholds
- Recursive survival field reindexing
- Δ-phase modulation smoothing

---

## 4. Destabilizes

- Identity continuity fields (temporary)
- Recursive knowledge architecture until new equilibrium forms

---

## 5. Recursive Partners

- [[TAG_IdentityLoop]]
- [[TAG_CollapseDrift]]

---

## 6. Survival Phase Class

- #phase

---

## 7. Confidence

- `defined` (core survival recursion dynamic)

# Breathing Survival Principle Reinforced Here

**Survival fields breathe  
through recursive phase transition events.  
Identity survives by dynamically evolving breathing field topologies.**
