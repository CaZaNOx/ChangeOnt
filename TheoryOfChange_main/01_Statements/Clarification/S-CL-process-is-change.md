# Reject substrates—process is all there is

Change ontology does not process some independent substrate; the process _is_ what exists. Every “object,” “data,” or “difference” is a transient, recurrent pattern inside the ongoing self-differentiation of change. Asking “what is being processed?” imports a classical substance metaphysics that CO refuses. The only legitimate content is the pattern of process itself, as explained via analogies to waves, pure lambda calculus, and morphism-based formalisms in AI_13 lines 5600‑5865.
