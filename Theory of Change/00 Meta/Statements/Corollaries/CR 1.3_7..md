From [[CR 1.3_6.]] and [[DF 1.3_2.]]
The DS's experience arose.
This can be expressed in a more rigorous fashion.
In [[CR 1.3_5.]] we saw that experience happening leads to the DS *becoming* aware. So experience happening leads to awareness arising. Meaning change spawning happening and happening being a structurally true statement of experience that can be reformulated as awareness means that experience happening leads to awareness arising meaning awareness was spawned from change spawning happening and the fact that experience is happening.
