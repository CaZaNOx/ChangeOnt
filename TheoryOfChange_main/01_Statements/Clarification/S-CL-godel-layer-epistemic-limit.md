# You cannot predict a new layer's concrete rules from its Gödel hole alone

Gödel holes mark the structural limit of the current layer, but they do not encode the detailed architecture—symbol set, encoding, invariants—of the emergent layer that resolves the contradiction. You can anticipate that “something must resolve this hole,” and you can sketch the shape or constraints that the new logic must satisfy, but any claim to recover the prior layer or fully predict the new rules breaks Gödel/Turing limits. Real knowledge is limited to the residue the prior layer leaves in the new logic; everything else is irretrievably compressed or abstracted away. This epistemic boundary is the honesty requirement AI_13 emphasizes in lines 11725‑11836.
