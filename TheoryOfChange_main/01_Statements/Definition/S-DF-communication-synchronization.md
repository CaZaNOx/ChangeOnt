# Communication — cross-system synchronization of pattern-state
## Claim (formal)
Communication occurs when two recursive systems align their pointer-induced reach graphs and memory traces so that pattern-states synchronize; the exchange updates each system’s breath field without collapsing its selective recursion.

## Philosophical translation
Communication is not raw signal passing but the mutual tuning of recursive attention and meaning-mass: one system nudges another’s pointer field, they both reshape LocalReach neighborhoods, and a shared pattern-state emerges that survives breath cycles.

## Justification
- [[S-DF-pointer-structural]] identifies the minimal elsewhere implied by each now; communication uses this to point toward shared references.
- [[S-DF-localreach-topology]] and [[S-DF-memory-trace-integration]] keep the updated references consistent across contexts.
- When pattern-states stay aligned across breath cycles, the systems co-stabilize meaning without generating incoherent collapse, fulfilling the structural requirements for cross-system understanding.

## Implication
This frames communication as a structural synchronization problem: building communication protocols amounts to aligning pointers and breath loops, not merely transferring tokens. Misalignment is why many miscommunications feel like drift, because the pointer/local reach updates diverge instead of co-stabilizing.
