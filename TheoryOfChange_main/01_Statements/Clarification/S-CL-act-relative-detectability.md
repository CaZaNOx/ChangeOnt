# Detectability & adjacency must stay act-relative
## Content
Every definition of the class of readable residues (E), adjacency `C`, and the detectability threshold `τ` must be tied to the current act of experience. They cannot presuppose an external timeline, metric, or object space. Instead, the act creates the residues, marks adjacencies, and defines `τ` by the minimal contrast it can register.

## Clarification
- `E` is the set of residues (events, traces) produced by *this* act; nothing else may be assumed.
- `τ` is not a global constant but the minimal structural contrast required for this act to distinguish two residues. Any numeric ordering must be derived from stable discriminations, not assumed.
- Adjacency `C(x,y)` holds only if no detectable gap > τ exists between them under the same act; extend this relation by chaining through act-relative traces (`C*`).

## Implication
Whenever you introduce new “space”, “now”, or “prior” language, rewrite it in terms of `E`, `τ`, and act-relative pointers (`↶`, `⇘`), or mark the definition as smuggling classical metaphysics. This keeps the ontology anchored to the performance of experiencing rather than to external abstractions.
