# Operator hygiene enforces act-relative semantics
## Content
Every operator (`↶`, `⇘`, `C`, `R`, `S`, `T`) must be defined relative to the present act and survive maximal doubt; they may not import world-level quantification, memory, or preexisting concepts without an explicit derivation.

## Clarification
- Whenever new symbols appear, verify they appear after their DF entries and reference their act-relative semantics, not external timelines or states.
- Numerical thresholds/gradients that appear before establishing ordinal emergence are flagged as smuggled classicality and must be rederived via structural discriminations.
- The recursion audit must watch for alias drift—each symbol must keep consistent meaning across sections.

## Implication
This hygiene prevents simulation narratives from sneaking in disguised as definitions; each operator stays anchored to the actual witnessing act rather than to preassigned object categories or clocks.
