# ⇘(x) — Field-level pointer to prior

Definition (formal):
Structural reference to earlier configuration at field level; not memory, but trace relation.

## Math
```text
\Downarrow(x): \text{points to prior field state at index } x
```

## Example
- Used to indicate field-level provenance in derivation traces.

## Related

- [[01_Statements/SYMBOLS/Pointer_meta]] (⇘²(x))

## Philosophical Translation (of formal definition)
It’s the “trace” that situates the present within its field’s own past.

## Philosophical Justification
Without traces, a field can’t relate to what it has been; change would be memoryless in an implausible way.

## Explanation (informal)
Use ⇘(x) to connect current derivations to prior field configurations.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Not a literal memory dump; it’s a structural pointer usable in proofs.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Specify pointer behavior under frame changes (Tx).
