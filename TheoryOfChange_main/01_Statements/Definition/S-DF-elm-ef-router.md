# Element — EF — Router (dynamic + math policy)
## Claim (formal)
Route between dynamic regimes and math contexts using bend/volatility, compressibility, and EMA history; emit dyn and math_context.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
Choose how to think — and how to move — based on what the world is doing now.

## Philosophical Justification
Different regimes demand different tools: high volatility favors robust dynamics; high compressibility supports aggressive consolidation; breath phase informs pacing. A router makes these choices explicit and auditable rather than implicit in ad‑hoc heuristics.

## Derivation (Formal/Operational)
```text
dyn := f(volatility_proxy, loopiness, phase)
math_context := g(compressibility, quantale_ready)
```
Emits dyn and math_context as explicit downstream inputs.

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Keep routing simple and explainable; avoid oscillations between regimes.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Evaluate regime switches with hysteresis; log decisions for audit.
