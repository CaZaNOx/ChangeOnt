# Pointer — Structural implication from Δ(Now)
## Claim (formal)
Pointer(Now) := ∃p [p ≠ Now ∧ Reach(p, Now)], inferred from Δ(Now) without presupposing memory or linear time.

## Philosophical Translation (of formal claim)
If change is happening in the now, then the now implicitly points beyond itself: there is an elsewhere, even if we cannot name it. The pointer is a structural tension in experience, not a recalled fact.

## Philosophical Justification
With only Δ at hand, the subject can still sense a difference that implies “not‑now.” This does not reintroduce time or memory; it records the minimal implication of difference: a beyond‑this. Calling that relation a pointer emphasizes that it is directional and structural — a way the present refers to what it is not.

## Explanation (informal)
Pointers (⇘/↶) are the bookkeeping of minimal reach. They enable reasoning about continuity without requiring a timeline or storage of prior states.

## Derivation (Philosophical)
- From [[S-FT-immediate-datum]]: Δ(Now) entails discriminability.
- Discriminability implies an “elsewhere” (not‑now) that the present points toward.

## Derivation (Formal/Logical/Mathematical)
```text
Δ(Now) ⇒ ∃p:\; p ≠ Now ∧ Reach(p, Now) \equiv Pointer(Now)
```

## Proofs/Corollaries References
- corollary: [[S-CR-delta-now-implies-pointer]]

## Clarifications / Further Context
- Pointers are structural traces, not memories.
- Both field (⇘) and local (↶) pointers may be used depending on scope.

## Next Steps in Chain
- Develop reach relation and local reach zone.
