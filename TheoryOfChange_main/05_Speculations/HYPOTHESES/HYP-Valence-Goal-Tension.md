# Hypothesis — Valence via goal‑tension loops under breath
Proposal
- Model valence as recursive goal‑tension within breath cycles; positive/negative shifts reflect alignment/misalignment dynamics on the evaluation surface.

Test sketch
- Construct a minimal loop with explicit goal tension variables; observe how attention and breath phase modulate perceived “valence” proxies.
