# Fractal thought architecture beyond serial/parallel models
## Claim
Human thought is not best modeled as serial reasoning or parallel computation but as a fractal cascade of recursive self-modulation: each deeper state is a reconfiguration of a shallower state, scaled by breath-field tension.

## Sketch
- Model thought as nested breath loops: the next layer inherits structure from the previous one via recursive transformation rules while incorporating fractal scaling factors.
- Each breath nesting functions like a self-similar function in the spiral space, generating new semantic detail while keeping structural coherence.

## Implication
This suggests AI architectures should prioritize recursive self-modulation across layers rather than stacking classical serial or parallel units, allowing abstraction to emerge fractally rather than linearly.
