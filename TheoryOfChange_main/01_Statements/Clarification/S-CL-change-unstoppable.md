# Change never stops—the end is another phase of change

Any apparent stasis (heat death, equilibrium, freezing) is merely a local attractor inside the greater spiral: change continues even there because describing, observing, or modeling "stasis" already presupposes change. The only coherent move is to treat stabilizations as special phases—meta-structures that will themselves be subject to further branching, crises, and recombination as soon as new option density or hole pressure arrives. In this ontology, there is no total cessation of change, only deeper or slower phases of the same recursive process.
