# Pointer — Reach — Locality — Depth — Tx

Scope
- Structural stitching from Δ(Now) to frame‑level change.

Core nodes
- DF: [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-pointer-structural]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-reach-relation]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-locality-prior]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-depth-reach]], [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-tx-operator]], [[01_Statements/Derivation/S-DR-pointer-behavior-under-tx]]
- CR: [[01_Statements/Corollary/S-CR-delta-now-implies-pointer]]

Key takeaways
- Δ(Now) implies a structural pointer beyond now; reach composes paths.
- Locality bounds admissible paths; depth orders priors.
- Tx captures frame‑level change; pointers behave predictably under Tx.

Open items
- Tx algebra refinements (composition identities) — see [[01_Statements/Definition/S-DF-tx-algebra]].
