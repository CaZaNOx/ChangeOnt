From [[FT 2.1_1.]] 
If there was no dynamism in change then nothing could happen.
If change were entirely static we wouldn't speak of change or happenings taking place.
This can be made clearer like this. We saw that happening entails change. If we reformulate [[FT 2.1_1.]]  as Change is happenings happening. If there was pure stasis the happenings couldn't happen. There would just be an eternal sameness. This can be formulated like this If Static is the opposite of change(will be revisited later) and dynamic means happenings happen this would lead to
1) No happenings happen
or
2) Happenings don't happen
Either option leads to happenings not happening because there is no happening or nothing that happens.
So if we would state that Chance is static we would say that Change means that nothing happens but we defined change in DF0.6 as that what happens. So if there was no happening the term change wouldn't be meaningful since there is nothing that happens and therefore change as defined in DF0.6 would never be the case.
